## All Papers

<!-- Available tags for tag filtering system with descriptions -->
<div id="available-tags" style="display: none;">
  <span data-tag="case study">Provides an in-depth analysis of one or a few specific LRD sources.</span>
  <span data-tag="catalog">Presents a list or table of LRD sources, candidates, or related objects with measured/derived properties.</span>
  <span data-tag="simulation">Uses computational models (hydrodynamical, cosmological, radiative transfer) to predict or interpret LRD properties.</span>
  <span data-tag="theory">Primarily discusses theoretical models, physical mechanisms, or interpretations of LRD phenomena.</span>
  <span data-tag="non-agn">Discusses or proposes scenarios other than AGN (e.g., compact starburst, mixed models) as the primary explanation for LRD properties.</span>
  <span data-tag="starburst">Investigates intense star formation activity as a primary or contributing factor to LRD properties.</span>
  <span data-tag="dust">Investigates the role of dust extinction, reddening, or obscuration in shaping LRD properties or identification.</span>
  <span data-tag="variability">Studies changes in brightness or spectral features of LRDs over time.</span>
  <span data-tag="x-ray">Discusses observations or properties in the X-ray part of the electromagnetic spectrum.</span>
  <span data-tag="sed">Focuses on the Spectral Energy Distribution (flux vs. wavelength), its shape (e.g., 'V-shape'), or modeling.</span>
  <span data-tag="spectroscopy">Obtains or analyzes spectra (flux vs. wavelength at high resolution) to determine redshift, composition, kinematics.</span>
  <span data-tag="jwst">Utilizes observational data primarily from the James Webb Space Telescope or discusses JWST's role in LRD discovery/study.</span>
  <span data-tag="non-jwst">Utilizes observational data primarily from telescopes or surveys *other than* the James Webb Space Telescope (e.g., HST, Spitzer, ALMA, ground-based).</span>
  <span data-tag="photometry">Derives or analyzes source brightness measurements from images taken through different filters (e.g., SED fitting).</span>
  <span data-tag="radio">Discusses observations or properties in the radio part of the electromagnetic spectrum.</span>
  <span data-tag="multi-wavelength">Combines data from significantly different spectral regions (e.g., Optical/IR + X-ray/Radio) for analysis.</span>
  <span data-tag="early universe">Pertains to cosmic epochs at high redshift (z > 4), the typical era where LRDs are found.</span>
  <span data-tag="local counterpart">Discusses potential counterparts or analogs to high-redshift LRDs found in the local or lower-redshift universe (e.g., z < 1).</span>
  <span data-tag="black hole mass">Discusses estimation or implications of the central supermassive black hole's mass, including SMBH growth.</span>
  <span data-tag="clustering">Analyzes the spatial distribution of LRDs or related objects to infer properties, environment, or connections.</span>
  <span data-tag="emission lines">Analyzes spectral emission lines (e.g., Balmer, forbidden lines), their widths, ratios, or diagnostic power.</span>
  <span data-tag="host galaxy">Studies the properties (stellar mass, size, star formation rate, morphology) of the galaxy hosting the LRD.</span>
  <span data-tag="kinematics">Examines the motion of gas or stars within the LRD or host galaxy, often derived from spectral line profiles.</span>
  <span data-tag="morphology">Focuses on the shape, size (e.g., effective radius), structure, or compactness of LRDs, usually from imaging.</span>
  <span data-tag="sample selection">Describes the methods, criteria, or biases involved in identifying and selecting LRD candidates for study.</span>

## About Awesome Little Red Dots

Awesome Little Red Dots (ALRD) is a collection of papers related to the study of "Little Red Dots" in astronomy. These are typically small, reddened objects that are often active galactic nuclei (AGNs) at high redshifts.

The bibliography is generated from a curated BibTeX file maintained in the [ALRD GitHub repository](https://github.com/wenkeren/Awesome-Little-Red-Dots).
