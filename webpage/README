 # Awesome Little Red Dots Bibliography Webpage

This directory contains the Jekyll-based bibliography website for the Awesome Little Red Dots (ASLRD) project. The website is automatically built and deployed to GitHub Pages whenever changes are made to the `webpage` or `library` directories.

## Structure

- The website uses Jekyll and the Jekyll-Scholar plugin to generate a bibliography from the BibTeX file in the `../library/` directory.
- The tag filtering system allows users to filter papers by tags defined in the LRD Literature Tags.yml file.

## Development

To run this website locally:

1. Install Ruby and Bundler
2. Run `bundle install` in this directory
3. Run `bundle exec jekyll serve` to start a local server

## Deployment

The website is automatically deployed to GitHub Pages using GitHub Actions. The workflow:

1. Copies the latest LRD Literature Tags.yml file from the library directory
2. Builds the Jekyll site
3. Deploys to GitHub Pages

## How It Works

- The bibliography is generated from the `aslrd.bib` file in the `../library/` directory
- The Jekyll-Scholar plugin processes this file and generates HTML for each bibliography entry
- The tag filtering system extracts tag information from the BibTeX entries and allows users to filter based on these tags
