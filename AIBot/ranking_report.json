      "title": "{'Little red dots' cannot reside in the same dark matter haloes as comparably luminous unobscured quasars}",
      "abstract": "{The JWST has uncovered a new population of candidate broad-line active galactic nucleus (AGN) emerging in the early Universe, named 'little red dots' (LRDs) because of their compactness and red colours at optical wavelengths. LRDs appear to be surprisingly abundant (<inline-formula><tex-math>${\\approx} 10^{-5} \\, {\\rm cMpc}^{-3}$</tex-math></inline-formula>) given that their inferred bolometric luminosities largely overlap with those of the ultraviolet (UV)-luminous quasars identified at high z in wide-field spectroscopic surveys. In this work, we investigate how the population of LRDs and/or other UV-obscured AGN relates to the one of unobscured, UV-selected quasars. By comparing their number densities, we infer an extremely large and rapidly evolving obscured:unobscured ratio, ranging from <inline- formula><tex-math>${\\approx} 20{:}1$</tex-math></inline-formula> at <inline-formula><tex-math>$z\\approx 4$</tex-math></inline- formula> to <inline-formula><tex-math>${\\approx} 2300{:}1$</tex- math></inline-formula> at <inline-formula><tex-math>$z\\approx 7$</tex-math></inline-formula>, and possibly extending out to very high (<inline-formula><tex-math>${\\approx} 10^{47}\\, {\\rm erg}\\, {\\rm s}^{-1}$</tex-math></inline-formula>) bolometric luminosities. This large obscured:unobscured ratio is incompatible with the UV-luminous duty cycle measured for unobscured quasars at <inline-formula><tex-math>$z\\approx 4\\!-\\!6$</tex-math></inline-formula>, suggesting that LRDs are too abundant to be hosted by the same haloes as unobscured quasars. This implies that either (a) the bolometric luminosities of LRDs are strongly overestimated or (b) LRDs follow different scaling relations than those of UV-selected quasars, representing a new population of accreting supermassive black holes emerging in the early Universe. A direct comparison between the clustering of LRDs and that of faint UV-selected quasars will ultimately confirm these findings and shed light on key properties of LRDs such as their host mass distribution and duty cycle. We provide a mock analysis for the clustering of LRDs and show that it is feasible with current and upcoming JWST surveys.}",

      "abstract": "{The JWST discovery of ``little red dots'' (LRDs) is reshaping our picture of the early Universe, yet the physical mechanisms driving their compact size and UV-optical colors remain elusive. Here, we report an unusually bright LRD (z$\\_{spec}$ = 3.1) observed as part of the RUBIES program. This LRD exhibits broad emission lines (FWHM {\\ensuremath{\\sim}} 4000 km s$^{‑1}$), a blue UV continuum, a clear Balmer break, and a red continuum sampled out to rest-frame 4 {\\ensuremath{\\mu}}m with MIRI. We develop a new joint galaxy and active galactic nucleus (AGN) model within the Prospector Bayesian inference framework and perform spectrophotometric modeling using NIRCam, MIRI, and NIRSpec/Prism observations. Our fiducial model reveals a M$\\_{*}$ {\\ensuremath{\\sim}} {}10$^{9}$ M$\\_{{\\ensuremath{\\odot}}}$ galaxy alongside a dust-reddened AGN driving the optical emission. Explaining the rest-frame optical color as a reddened AGN requires A$\\_{V}$ {\\ensuremath{\\gtrsim}} 3, suggesting that a great majority of the accretion disk energy is reradiated as dust emission. Yet, despite clear AGN signatures, we find a surprising lack of hot torus emission, which implies that either the dust emission in this object must be cold, or the red continuum must instead be driven by a massive, evolved stellar population of the host galaxy{\\textemdash}seemingly inconsistent with the high-EW broad lines (H{\\ensuremath{\\alpha}} rest-frame EW {\\ensuremath{\\sim}} 800 {\\r{A}}). The widths and luminosities of Pa-{\\ensuremath{\\beta}}, Pa-{\\ensuremath{\\delta}}, Pa-{\\ensuremath{\\gamma}}, and H{\\ensuremath{\\alpha}} imply a modest black hole mass of M$\\_{BH}$ {\\ensuremath{\\sim}} {}10$^{8}$ M$\\_{{\\ensuremath{\\odot}}}$. Additionally, we identify a narrow blueshifted He I {\\ensuremath{\\lambda}} 1.083 {\\ensuremath{\\mu}}m absorption feature in NIRSpec/G395M spectra, signaling an ionized outflow with kinetic energy up to {\\ensuremath{\\sim}}1\\% the luminosity of the AGN. The low redshift of RUBIES-BLAGN-1, combined with the depth and richness of the JWST imaging and spectroscopic observations, provides a unique opportunity to build a physical model for these so-far mysterious LRDs, which may prove to be a crucial phase in the early formation of massive galaxies and their supermassive black holes.}",

      "title": "{The Composite Spectrum of the Little Red Dots from an Inner Standard Disk and an Outer Gravitationally Unstable Disk}",
      "abstract": "{One of the most mysterious results from observations of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is the detection of numerous, high- redshift, very red, extremely compact, broad-line sources termed ``little red dots'' (LRDs). It is unclear whether the LRDs belong to an active galactic nucleus (AGN) or simply a collection of very compact star clusters. We build spectral energy distributions (SEDs) for 29 LRDs at $z \\approx 3-8.5$ based on JWST photometric and spectroscopic observations. We find that the V-shaped SEDs of these LRDs exhibit a roughly similar break frequency at $ν\\_{\\rm b}=10^{14.96\\pm0.06}$ Hz, which corresponds to $λ\\_{\\rm b}=3287\\_{-424}^{+487} \\textÅ$ in the rest frame. We propose that this unique SED can be explained by the combination of an inner standard disk and an outer gravitationally unstable accretion disk with Toomre parameter $Q\\sim1$. The outer disk has a temperature of $\\sim2000-4000$ K for typical AGN parameters, which can well reproduce the near- infrared to optical bump as observed in LRDs. This model can naturally explain the strong infrared to optical emission and the V-shaped SED with a similar break frequency $\\simeq 10^{15}$ Hz for LRDs without invoking strong dust extinction or unusual stellar contribution from a host galaxy. Most LRDs stay in sub- Eddington state based on the SED modeling, which are intrinsically weak in X-rays.}",

      "title": "{Exploring the Active Galactic Nucleus Fraction of a Sample of JWST's Little Red Dots at 4 < z < 8: Overmassive Black Holes Are Strongly Favored}",
      "abstract": "{JWST is revolutionizing our view of the early Universe by pushing the boundaries of detectable galaxies and black holes in redshift (upward) and mass (downward). The little red dots (LRDs), detected by several surveys at z > 4, present a significant interpretational challenge, as their spectral energy distributions (SEDs) can mimic both active galactic nucleus (AGN) and stellar population templates. This study analyzes 19 LRDs from the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey survey, utilizing NIRCam and MIRI photometry. By performing SED fitting across a vast parameter space, we explore a broad range of AGN fractions, defined as the ratio of the monochromatic luminosities (AGN, galaxy, and dust) over a specified wavelength range, 0.4{\\textendash}0.7 {\\ensuremath{\\mu}}m rest frame. We find that 17 of the 19 LRDs investigated are consistent with having significant AGN contributions, with best-fitting AGN fractions ranging between 20\\% and 70\\%, while one galaxy shows a low AGN contribution (2\\%) and another appears to be purely star forming. Moreover, assuming these LRDs do indeed host AGN, we can place limits on their black hole masses using the inferred AGN bolometric luminosities and adopting the Eddington limit. We find that, independent of the specific AGN fraction adopted, the LRDs' black holes are significantly overmassive relative to their host galaxies{\\textemdash}by {\\ensuremath{\\sim}}1 dex, and up to {\\ensuremath{\\sim}}4 dex in the most extreme cases{\\textemdash}compared to the local M$\\_{{\\textbullet}}${\\textendash}M$\\_{{\\ensuremath{\\star}}}$ relation.

      "abstract": "{The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has revealed a population of red and compact sources at z {\\ensuremath{\\gtrsim}} 5 known as ``little red dots'' (LRDs) that are likely active galactic nuclei (AGNs). Here, we present a comprehensive study of the variability of 314 LRDs with multi-epoch JWST observations in five deep fields: Ultra Deep Survey, GOODS-S, GOODS-N, A2744, and COSMOS. Our analyses use all publicly available JWST NIRCam imaging data in these fields, together with multi-epoch JWST MIRI images available. We measure the significance (signal-to- noise ratio or SNR$\\_{var}$) of the variabilities for all LRDs and statistically evaluate their variabilities using the SNR$\\_{var}$ distributions. We pay particular attention to the systematic offsets of photometric zero-points among different epochs that seem to commonly exist. The derived SNR$\\_{var}$ distributions of the LRDs, including those with broad H{\\ensuremath{\\alpha}}/H{\\ensuremath{\\beta}} emission lines, follow the standard Gaussian distribution, and are generally consistent with those of the comparison samples of objects detected in the same images. This finding suggests that the LRD population, on average, does not show strong variability, which can be explained by super-Eddington accretion of the black holes in AGNs. Alternatively, many of them may be dominated by galaxies. We also find eight strongly variable LRD candidates with variability amplitudes of 0.24{\\textendash}0.82 mag. The rest-frame optical spectral energy distributions of these variable LRDs should have a significant AGN contribution. Future JWST observations will provide more variability information on LRDs.}",

Most of the LRDs with existing spectral observations exhibit broad Balmer lines and are thus likely to host active galactic nuclei (AGNs). Here we present a study of LRDs with no broad H-alpha component. Our sample consists of five LRDs at z\\raisebox{-0.5ex}\\textasciitilde5 with H-alpha line widths of about 250 km/s. They are selected from 32 LRDs that have NIRSpec high- or medium-resolution grating spectra covering H-alpha. During our construction of the sample, we find that approximately 20 percent of the LRD candidates previously selected do not show red continuum emission but resemble the V-shape spectra due to strong line emission. Compared to normal star-forming galaxies, narrow-line LRDs tend to have relatively higher H-alpha line widths and luminosities. If these LRDs are dominated by galaxies, our SED modeling suggests that they are dusty, compact star-forming galaxies with high stellar masses and star formation rates (SFRs). Alternatively, if their SEDs are produced by AGNs, the inferred central black hole masses (MBH) are in the range of 10\\^5 to 10\\^6 solar masses, placing them at the low-mass end of the AGN population. They may represent an early stage of super-Eddington growth, where the black holes have yet to accumulate significant masses. With large measurement uncertainties, these black holes appear slightly overmassive relative to the local MBH-Mstar relation, but consistent or undermassive with respect to the MBH-sigma and MBH-Mdyn relations. We further find that nearly half of the high-redshift broad-line AGNs exhibit V-shape SEDs. (abridged)}",

      "abstract": "{Recent James Webb Space Telescope observations have revealed a peculiar class of galaxies at redshifts z {\\ensuremath{\\gtrsim}} 6, characterized by extremely high central stellar densities and overmassive central supermassive black holes (SMBHs), ``little red dots'' (LRDs). A critical question remains: if LRDs were common at high redshifts, how would they evolve into local elliptical galaxies with significantly lower central densities? To address this, we performed direct N-body simulations of LRD mergers, focusing on the coevolution of host galaxies and central SMBHs. We track the complete evolution of SMBH binaries into the three-body hardening and gravitational-wave (GW) emission phase. Our results demonstrate that during galaxy mergers, the central SMBHs can eject a substantial amount of mass from the galactic core via the three-body slingshot effect, leading to a decrease in central stellar surface density by an order of magnitude. Additionally, GW recoil can further contribute in making the galaxy centers less dense and more in alignment with low-redshift quiescent galaxies. This transformation occurs on a relatively short timescale of a few {\\ensuremath{\\sim}}100 Myr, implying that LRDs can evolve into lower-redshift elliptical galaxies by z < 4. The timescales for our SMBH mergers vary between 100 and 800 Myr, depending on the initial orbital parameters of the merging galaxies and the mass ratio of the SMBHs. Our findings provide a plausible mechanism for the transformation of LRDs into elliptical galaxies while highlighting the efficiency of SMBH mergers in such high-density environments, which plays a crucial role in SMBH growth.}",

      "abstract": "{JWST observations have uncovered a new population of red, compact objects at high redshifts dubbed ``little red dots'' (LRDs), which typically show broad emission lines and are thought to be dusty active galactic nuclei (AGNs). Some of their other features, however, challenge the AGN explanation, such as prominent Balmer breaks and extremely faint or even missing metal high-ionization lines, X-ray, or radio emission, including in deep stacks. Time variability is another robust test of AGN activity. Here, we exploit the z = 7.045 multiply imaged LRD A2744-QSO1, which offers a particularly unique test of variability due to lensing-induced time delays between the three images spanning 22 yr (2.7 yr in the rest-frame), to investigate its photometric and spectroscopic variability. We find the equivalent widths (EWs) of the broad H{\\ensuremath{\\alpha}} and H{\\ensuremath{\\beta}} lines, which are independent of magnification and other systematics, to exhibit significant variations, of up to 18 {\\ensuremath{\\pm}} 3\\% for H{\\ensuremath{\\alpha}} and up to 22 {\\ensuremath{\\pm}} 8\\% in H{\\ensuremath{\\beta}}, on a timescale of 875 d (2.4 yr) in the rest-frame. This suggests that A2744-QSO1 is indeed an AGN. We find no significant photometric variability beyond the limiting systematic uncertainties, so it currently cannot be determined whether the EW variations are due to line-flux or continuum variability. These results are consistent with a typical damped random walk variability model for an AGN such as A2744-QSO1 (M$\\_{BH}$ = 4 {\\texttimes} {}10$^{7}$ M$\\_{{\\ensuremath{\\odot}}}$) given the sparse sampling of the light curve with the available data. Our results therefore support the AGN interpretation of this LRD, and highlight the need for further photometric and spectroscopic monitoring in order to build a detailed and reliable light curve.}",

The relative contribution of galaxy starlight and AGN to these systems remains uncertain, especially for the galaxies with unusual blue+red spectral energy distributions. In this work, we use Balmer decrements to measure the independent dust attenuation of the broad and narrow emission-line components of a sample of 29 broad-line AGN identified from three public JWST spectroscopy surveys: CEERS, JADES, and RUBIES.

We use a multistep pre-selection and Bayesian fitting to ensure a high- quality sample of sources with broad Balmer lines and narrow forbidden lines. We compute rest-frame ultraviolet and optical spectral slopes for these objects, and determine that 21 BLAGNs in our sample are also little red dots (LRDs).

Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) as part of the VLA Frontier Fields program, whose goal is to explore the radio continuum emission from high-redshift galaxies that are magnified by foreground, massive galaxy clusters. With an rms noise of $\\approx 1 μ$Jy beam$^{-1}$, at the phase center, and sub-arcsec angular resolution ($θ\\_{1/2}=0.82$ arcsec), this is the deepest and most detailed radio image of Abell 2744 ever obtained. A total of 93 sources are detected with a peak signal-to-noise ratio $\\geq5$, of which 46 have optical/near-infrared (IR) counterparts with available redshift, magnification ($μ$), and stellar mass (${M}\\_*$) estimates. The radio sources are distributed over a redshift from 0.15 to 3.55, with a median redshift value of $z = 0.93$, and a median stellar mass of ${M}\\_{*}= 2.3 \\times 10^{10}\\,\\rm{M}\\_{\\odot}$. A comparison between the radio-based star formation rates (SFRs) and those derived from ultraviolet- to-near IR data reveals that the radio SFRs are, on average, an order of magnitude higher than the ultraviolet-to-near IR SFRs. We look for radio counterparts of the so-called ``Little Red Dots (LRDs)'' galaxies at $z\\approx6$ in Abell 2744, but find no significant detections.

The spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of this LRD pair show evidence of a Balmer break, consistent with a recent ({\\ensuremath{\\sim}}100 Myr) quenching of star formation. In contrast, the satellites are compatible with a recent-onset ({\\ensuremath{\\sim}}100 Myr), ongoing burst of star formation. LRD1's SED is consistent with a dust-free active galactic nucleus (AGN) being the source of the UV excess in the galaxy. The optical continuum would be powered by the emission from an obscured post-starburst and the AGN at a subdominant level. LRD2's SED is more ambiguous, but it could also be indicative of a dust-free AGN. In this scenario, these LRDs would be massive (M$\\_{{\\ensuremath{\\star}}}$ {\\ensuremath{\\sim}} {}10$^{10}$ M$\\_{{\\ensuremath{\\odot}}}$) and dusty (A(V) > 1 mag) and the three satellites would be lower- mass objects (M$\\_{{\\ensuremath{\\star}}}$ {\\ensuremath{\\sim}} 10$^{8 ‑ 9}$ M$\\_{{\\ensuremath{\\odot}}}$) subject to low dust attenuations.

Their existence raises many questions about their nature, origin, and evolution. These galaxies show a steep decline in number density-nearly two orders of magnitude-from $z=6$ to $z=3$. In this study, we explore their potential evolution by identifying candidate descendants in CEERS, assuming a single evolutionary path: the development of a blue star-forming outskirt around the red compact core. Our color-magnitude selection identifies galaxies as red as LRDs at $z<4$, surrounded by young, blue stellar outskirts. Morphological parameters were derived from single S{\\'e}rsic profile fits; physical properties were obtained from SED fitting using a stellar-only model. These ``post-LRD'' candidates show LRD-like features with $M\\_\\ast \\sim 10^{10} \\ M\\_\\odot $, central densities ($ Σ\\_\\ast \\sim 10^{11} \\ M\\_\\odot \\ \\text{kpc}^{-2}$ ), compact sizes, and red rest-frame colors, but with an added extended component. Their number density at $z = 3 \\pm 0.5$ ( $ \\sim 10^{-4.15} \\, \\text{Mpc}^{-3} $) matches that of LRDs at $5 < z < 7$ , supporting a possible evolutionary link. We observe a redshift-dependent increase in outskirts mass fraction and galaxy size-from $\\sim 250$ pc at $ z = 5 $ to $\\sim 600$ pc at $ z = 3 $-suggesting global stellar growth. Meanwhile, the core remains red and compact, but the V-shape fades as the outskirts grow. These findings support an evolutionary scenario in which LRDs gradually acquire an extended stellar component over cosmic time by cold accretion. This may explain the apparent decline in their observed number density at lower redshift.}",

      "abstract": "{We investigate the possibility that the recently identified population of high-redshift, obscured quasars - known as ``Little Red Dots'' (LRDs) - originates from early black hole seed formation driven by ultra-strongly self-interacting dark matter (uSIDM). In this framework, dark matter halos undergo gravothermal core collapse due to large self-interaction cross sections, resulting in the rapid formation of massive black hole (BH) seeds with masses $rsim 10^{5} M\\_\\odot$ at redshifts $z rsim 5$. We develop a semi-analytic model that tracks the evolution of the dark matter halo population, the redshift of collapse $z\\_{\\rm coll}$, and the corresponding BH mass function. Black hole growth is modeled stochastically via a log-normal Eddington ratio distribution and a finite duty cycle. We find that the uSIDM scenario naturally reproduces key observed properties of LRDs, including their abundance, compactness, and characteristic BH masses, while offering a mechanism for early, obscured black hole formation that is difficult to achieve in standard CDM- based models. The predicted SMBH mass function at $z \\sim 5$ shows excellent agreement with LRD observational data and SIDM merger-tree simulations, particularly at the high-mass end $(m\\_{\\rm BH} rsim 10^{7} M\\_\\odot)$. These results suggest that LRDs may serve as powerful observational tracers of exotic dark sector physics and that SMBH formation in the early universe could be significantly shaped by non-gravitational dark matter interactions.}",

We employ Monte Carlo simulations to solve the Smoluchowski coagulation equation and determine the runaway merging timescale. The resulting stochastic gravitational wave background offers a distinct signature of this process, and the forming SMBHs can be highly spinning at their formation due to the spin residual of the cluster from tidal fields.

We report the discovery of three local LRDs at $z = 0.1-0.2$, initially selected from the SDSS database, with follow-up optical/near-IR spectroscopy and photometry. They exhibit properties fully consistent with those of high-redshift LRDs, including broad hydrogen and helium emission lines, compact morphologies, V-shaped UV-optical SED, declining near-IR continua, and no significant variability. Two sources were targeted but not detected in X-rays with statistical significance. All three sources show blue-shifted He I absorption, while two exhibit H$α$ and Na D absorption lines. We detect full Balmer and Paschen line series in all three objects, along with abundant narrow [Fe II] emission in two. The emission line analyses suggest narrow lines originate from AGN-powered metal-poor regions with minimal dust; broad lines come from inner regions with exceptionally high density or atypical dust properties; and [Fe II] emission arises from dense gas between broad and narrow-line regions. One of our objects, J1025+1402 (nicknamed ``The Egg''), shows extremely high equivalent width Na D, K I, Fe II, and Ca II triplet absorption lines, suggesting the presence of a cool ($\\sim$5000 K), metal-enriched gas envelope. The optical/near-IR continua of these LRDs are also consistent with theoretical models featuring an atmosphere around black holes. The WISE-detected IR emission is consistent with weak dust emission of $T \\sim 10^2-10^3$ K. We propose a conceptual model consisting of a largely thermalized cool-gas envelope surrounding the central black hole and an extended emission line region with high-density outflowing gas to explain the observed properties of these local LRDs.}",

Concurrently, the rapid assembly of the first supermassive black holes (SMBHs) requires the formation of heavy seeds, for which supermassive stars (SMSs) are leading theoretical progenitors. In this work, we perform the first quantitative test of the hypothesis that LRDs are the direct observational manifestation of these primordial SMSs.

We establish that its luminosity ($L\\_λ\\approx 1.7 \\times 10^{44} \\, \\text{erg} \\, \\text{s}^{-1} \\, μ\\text{m}^{-1}$ at 4050 Angstroms) provides a decisive constraint, matching prominent LRDs. Our model self-consistently reproduces their defining spectral features: the extreme, V-shaped Balmer break is an intrinsic photospheric effect, while the complex line phenomenology, strong H$β$ in emission with other Balmer lines in absorption arises from non-LTE effects in a single stellar atmosphere. Applying physically motivated broadening, our spectrum provides an excellent quantitative match to LRDs at both high ($z=7.76$) and low ($z=3.55$) redshift. Our model provides a simple, self-consistent physical picture for LRDs, offering a compelling alternative to multi-component obscured AGN scenarios and suggesting we may be directly witnessing the final, luminous moments of an SMBH progenitor before its ultimate collapse.}",

The 13 objects presented here were originally selected from a rest-frame ultraviolet (UV) imaging survey over >1000 deg$^{2}$, and were known to have luminous (>{}10$^{43}$ erg s$^{‑1}$) Ly{\\ensuremath{\\alpha}} emission. With JWST/NIRSpec follow-up observations, we found that 7 out of 11 objects with narrow Ly{\\ensuremath{\\alpha}} exhibit a broad component in H I Balmer lines and He I lines, but not in [O III] and other forbidden lines. Mild dust obscuration (0 < A$\\_{V}$ < 3) is inferred from the Balmer decrements. The estimated intrinsic luminosities suggest that our broad-line (BL) objects are the long-sought UV-obscured counterparts of luminous quasars in the EoR. They host supermassive black holes (SMBHs) with masses 10$^{7.8‑9.1}$M$\\_{{\\ensuremath{\\odot}}}$, undergoing sub- Eddington to Eddington accretion. Most of the BL objects are spatially unresolved and are close to ``little red dots'' with their blue rest-UV and red rest-optical colors. We estimate the AGN number density among similarly luminous Ly{\\ensuremath{\\alpha}} emitters to be larger than 2 {\\texttimes} 10$^{‑8}$ Mpc$^{‑3}$. This density is comparable to that of classical quasars with similar continuum luminosities, suggesting that a substantial fraction of active SMBHs are obscured in the EoR and have been overlooked in past rest-UV surveys.}",

      "abstract": "{The James Webb Space Telescope has detected massive black holes (BHs) with masses of {\\ensuremath{\\sim}}10$^{6‑8}$ M$\\_{{\\ensuremath{\\odot}}}$ within the first billion years of the Universe. One of the remarkable findings is the identification of ``little red dots'' (LRDs), a unique class of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) with distinct characteristics representing a key phase in the formation and growth of early BHs. Here, we analyze the occurrence rate of LRDs, which emerge around redshifts z {\\ensuremath{\\sim}} 6{\\textendash}8 and sharply decline at z < 4. We find that this trend follows a log-normal distribution, commonly observed in phenomena driven by stochastic and random factors. We propose a hypothesis that the first one or two AGN events associated with newly formed seed BHs are observed as LRDs, and their unique features fade in the subsequent episodes. This naturally explains the cosmic evolution of AGN abundance over 0 < z < 5, which follows {\\ensuremath{\\propto}}(1 + z)$^{‑5/2}$ due to the cumulative effect of recurring AGN activity. The unique characteristics of LRDs are likely linked to the dense gas environments around the seed BHs, which create strong absorption features in the broad-line emission and enable super-Eddington accretion bursts, ultimately yielding the observed overmassive nature of BHs compared to the local relationship. An analytical expression for the redshift evolution of LRD abundance is provided for direct comparison with future observational constraints.}",

Building upon previous work, we provide an improved framework to compute the complete halo mass function for these string seeded overdensities, valid for any loop velocity distribution. Using this mass function, we also compute the subset of halos capable of undergoing a direct collapse, forming a population of black holes with initial mass $10^{4-5} \\, M\\_{\\odot}$ at high redshifts.

      "abstract": "{Little Red Dots (LRDs) are compact, red sources discovered by JWST at high redshift ($z rsim 4$), marked by distinctive ``V-shaped'' spectral energy distributions (SEDs) and often interpreted as rapidly accreting AGNs. Their evolution remains unclear, as identifying counterparts at lower redshifts is challenging. We present WISEA J123635.56+621424.2 (here dubbed \\{\\textbackslashit the Saguaro\\}), a $z=2.0145$ galaxy in GOODS- North, as a possible analog of high-redshift LRDs and a potential missing link in their evolutionary path toward lower- redshift systems. It features a compact LRD-like nucleus surrounded by a face-on spiral host. Its connection to LRDs includes that: (1) its nuclear spectrum shows a clear ``V-shaped'' SED; and (2) when redshifted to $z=7$, surface brightness dimming makes the host undetectable, thus mimicking an LRD. This suggests that high-redshift LRDs may be embedded in extended hosts. To test this, we stack rest-frame UV images of 99 photometrically selected LRDs, revealing faint, diffuse emission. Stacking in redshift bins reveals mild radial growth, consistent with the expected galaxy size evolution. A simple analytic model confirms that surface brightness dimming alone can explain their compact appearance. Lastly, we show that \\{\\textbackslashit the Saguaro\\} is not unique by describing similar objects from the literature at $z\\lesssim3.5$. Taken together, our results support a scenario in which LRDs may not be a distinct population, but could be the visible nuclei of galaxies undergoing a short-lived, AGN-dominated evolutionary phase, with their compact, red appearance driven largely by observational biases.}",

They are believed to be analogs of high-redshift galaxies that reionized the Universe, and, indeed, the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is now uncovering such populations at record redshifts. Intriguingly, JWST finds evidence suggestive of active galactic nuclei (AGN) in many of these distant galaxies, including the elusive Little Red Dots, which broadly lack any detectable X-ray counterparts. Intuitively, one would expect to detect an AGN in their low-redshift analogs with X-rays, yet no study to date has conclusively identified an X-ray AGN within a Green Pea galaxy. Here we present the deepest X-ray campaign of a Green Pea galaxy performed to date, obtained with the goal of discerning the presence of a (potentially low-luminosity) AGN. The target{\\textemdash}SDSS J082247.66+224144.0 (hereafter J0822+2241){\\textemdash}was previously found to display a comparable X-ray spectral shape to more local AGN ({\\ensuremath{\\Gamma}} {\\ensuremath{\\sim}} 2) and a high luminosity (L$\\_{2‑10 keV}$ {\\ensuremath{\\sim}} {}10$^{42}$ erg s$^{‑1}$).

We discuss possible scenarios to explain the X-ray properties of J0822+2241, finding transient low column density obscuration surrounding an AGN to be the only plausible scenario. J0822+2241 thus provides further evidence that low-luminosity AGN activity could have contributed to the epoch of reionization and that local analogs are useful to derive a complete multiwavelength picture of black hole growth in high-redshift, low-luminosity AGNs. *Based on observations obtained with XMM-Newton, an ESA science mission with instruments and contributions directly funded by ESA Member States and NASA.}",

We model LRDs as super-massive stars (SMSs) surrounded by massive self- gravitating accretion discs (SMDs) that form as a consequence of gas-rich major galaxy mergers. The model provides an excellent match for numerous spectral features of LRDs, where the V-shape arises from the superposition of two black bodies, and Balmer line broadening is sourced by the intrinsic rotation of the SMD. No additional AGN, stellar wind, dust obscuration or galactic component is required. This results in a model with uniquely few, physically motivated free parameters that are robust to variations in observed LRD properties. We perform MCMC fits for two representative LRD spectra, for which the full parameter posterior distributions are determined. Allowing for a compressed SMS mass-radius relation, the recovered parameters are compatible with sub-Eddington accretion in self-gravitating discs, and the recovered SMS masses of few $ 10^6$ M$\\_{\\odot}$ imply the subsequent formation of massive black holes (BH) that squarely follow the expected BH mass--galaxy mass relation.

First identified as a high-redshift LRD candidate from PRIMER NIRCam photometry, follow-up NIRSpec/PRISM spectroscopy of CAPERS- LRD-z9 from the CANDELS-Area Prism Epoch of Reionization Survey (CAPERS) has revealed a broad 3500 km s$^{‑1}$ full width at half-maximum H{\\ensuremath{\\beta}} emission line and narrow [O III] {\\ensuremath{\\lambda}}{\\ensuremath{\\lambda}}4959, 5007 lines, indicative of a BLAGN.

This upper limit on the stellar mass of the host galaxy (<{}10$^{9}$ M$\\_{{\\ensuremath{\\odot}}}$) implies that the black hole to stellar mass ratio may be extremely large, possibly >5\\% (although systematic uncertainties on the black hole mass prevent strong conclusions).

      "abstract": "{The little red dots (LRDs) are high-redshift galaxies uncovered by JWST, characterized by small effective radii (R$\\_{eff}$ {\\ensuremath{\\sim}} 80{\\textendash}300 pc), number densities intermediate between typical galaxies and quasars, and a redshift distribution peaked at z {\\ensuremath{\\sim}} 5. We present a theoretical model in which the LRDs descend from dark matter halos in the extreme low-spin tail of the angular momentum distribution. Within this framework, we explain their three key observational signatures: (i) abundance, (ii) compactness, and (iii) redshift distribution. Our model focuses on observed, not modeled, properties; it is thus independent of whether they are powered primarily by a black hole or stars. We find that the assumption that the prototypical LRD at z {\\ensuremath{\\sim}} 5 originates from halos in the lowest {\\ensuremath{\\sim}}1\\% of the spin distribution is sufficient to reproduce both their observed number densities and physical sizes. The redshift evolution of their observability is driven by the interplay between the evolving compact disk fraction and cosmological surface brightness dimming. This effect leads to a well-defined ``LRD era'' at 4 < z < 8, during which the LRDs are common and detectable; at z < 4, they are bright but rare, while at z > 8, they are common but faint. Finally, we test the predicted redshift trend against observational data, finding excellent agreement. Additional observational support comes from their excess small-scale clustering and spectral signatures of extreme core densities, both of which are expected outcomes of galaxy formation in low-spin halos. These findings suggest that the LRDs are not a fundamentally distinct population but the natural manifestation of galaxies forming in the rarest, lowest angular momentum environments.}",

      "abstract": "{One of the most puzzling discoveries by JWST is the population of high- redshift, red, and compact galaxies dubbed little red dots (LRDs). Based on broad-line diagnostics, these galaxies have been argued to host accreting {}10$^{7}${\\textendash}{}10$^{8}$ M$\\_{{\\ensuremath{\\odot}}}$ supermassive black holes (SMBHs), a claim with crucial consequences for our understanding of how the first black holes form and grow over cosmic time. A key feature of LRDs is their extreme X-ray weakness: analyses of individual and stacked sources have yielded nondetections or only tentative, inconclusive X-ray signals, except for a handful of individual cases. Although high obscuration is the most straightforward way to explain the X-ray weakness of LRDs, JWST rest-frame optical/UV spectra initially argued against the presence of Compton-thick gas clouds. Instead, several authors have proposed that LRDs are intrinsically X-ray weak due to super-Eddington accretion rates. In this work, we observationally test these tailored models by stacking X-ray data for 55 LRDs in the Chandra Deep Field South, accumulating a total exposure time of nearly 400 Ms. Despite reaching unprecedented X-ray depths, our stack still yields a nondetection. The corresponding upper limits are deep enough to rule out current super-Eddington accretion models and are compatible only with extremely high levels of obscuration (N$\\_{H}$ {\\ensuremath{\\gtrsim}} {}10$^{25}$ cm$^{‑2}$). To explain the X-ray weakness of LRDs, we therefore speculate that the SMBHs in these systems are neither as massive nor as luminous as currently believed.}",

The resulting shock heating and compression encourage starburst activities, which subsequently photo-ionize the gas into HII, that in turn shines into the rest-optical via bremsstrahlung radiation within the minimal-timescale-cutoff (i.e., red) regime, before escaping back into the intergalactic space, propelled by the newly fusion-injected energy.}",

      "abstract": "{The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has discovered a new population of objects, the Little Red Dots (LRDs), characterized by V-shaped spectra indicative of strong breaks around the Balmer limit and compact morphology that gave them their name. A popular explanation is that they are a sub-population of active galactic nuclei/supermassive black holes (AGN/SMBHs) predominantly found in the high-redshift Universe ($zrsim3$). Similarly, direct collapse black holes (DCBHs), theorized to form from collapsing massive, extremely metal-poor gas clouds, have been invoked to explain high-redshift quasars, the most massive AGN sub- population. Here, we employ the semi-analytical code A-SLOTH to produce a population of DCBHs and compare them against observed LRD demographics and properties. Specifically, we compare the DCBH-seeded SMBH population against the standard stellar-remnant seeds and find that DCBH models agree better with observed LRD population statistics and host halo properties. Furthermore, for the most extreme and earliest LRD detections, interpreted to be systems with an AGN but little stellar component, DCBHs are able to reproduce the observed spectral shape and properties under multiple scenarios - high dust attenuation or AGN surrounded by dense gas - that have been proposed to explain the unique shape of LRD spectra. Even when super-Eddington accretion, invoked previously to explain the nature of LRDs, is enforced on stellar remnant seeds, the spectral characteristics of extreme LRDs cannot be reproduced. We emphasize the importance of gas- metallicity observations as an additional dimension besides the widely used SMBH-stellar mass ratios to further constrain the progenitors of LRDs.}",

      "abstract": "{The nature of Little Red Dots (LRDs) has largely been investigated through their continuum emission, with lines assumed to arise from a broad-line region. In this paper, we instead use recombination lines to infer the intrinsic properties of the central engine of LRDs. Our analysis first reveals a tension between the ionizing properties implied from H$α$ and HeII$\\,λ$4686. The high H$α$ EWs require copious H-ionizing photons, more than the bluest AGN ionizing spectra can provide. In contrast, HeII emission is marginally detected, and its low EW is, at most, consistent with the softest AGN spectra. The low HeII/H$β$ ($\\sim10^{-2}$, $<20\\times$ local AGN median) further points to an unusually soft ionizing spectrum. We extend our analysis to dense gas environments (the ``black-hole star'' hypothesis), and find that hydrogen recombination lines become optically thick and lose diagnostic power, but HeII remains optically thin and a robust tracer. Photoionization modeling with Cloudy rules out standard AGN accretion disk spectra. Alternative explanations include: exotic AGN with red rest- optical emission; a very high \\{\\textbackslashit average\\} optical depth ($>10$) from gas/dust; and/or soft ionizing spectra with abundant H-ionizing photons, consistent with e.g., a cold accretion disk or a composite of AGN and stars. The latter is an intriguing scenario since high hydrogen densities are highly conducive for star formation, and nuclear star clusters are found in the immediate vicinity of local massive black holes. While previous studies have mostly focused on features dominated by the absorbing hydrogen cloud, the HeII- based diagnostic proposed here represents a crucial step toward understanding the central engine of LRDs.}",

      "abstract": "{We analyze eight spectroscopically confirmed Little Red Dots (LRDs) at redshifts z = 5.1-8.7 with JWST/NIRCam, NIRSpec, and MIRI data. The LRDs have red NIRCam colors, F150W-F444W > 1, but flat NIRCam-MIRI colors, -0.5 < F444W - F770W < 0.5, suggesting weak warm/hot dust components. The LRDs have -1.0 < F1000W - F1500W < 1.1, suggestive of non-uniform rest near-IR properties within the sample. We model the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of the LRDs using the CIGALE and Prospector codes to assess how the differing templates impact the interpretation for LRDs for cases of: (1) models with star-forming stellar populations only; (2) active galactic nuclei (AGN) dominated models; and (3) composite AGN and star-forming models. Using the Bayesian information criterion, we find that six of the eight LRDs favor AGN models compared to star-forming models, though no model can fully reproduce all of the observed properties. Two LRDs with pronounced Balmer-breaks and broad H$\\_α$ have SEDs that can be reproduced with hot, dense-gas (log T/K=5-5.7, log n/cm$^{-3}$ = 9-11) models with low dust attenuation (A(V)\\raisebox{-0.5ex}\\textasciitilde 0.5mag). However, these models require an additional thermal component (800-1400K) to account for the MIRI data, and fail to reproduce the rest-UV and narrow [OIII] emission. The total bolometric emission from the dense-gas models, and possibly CIGALE AGN models, appear consistent with literature constraints in the far-IR and radio, and require log L$\\_{bol}$/L$\\_\\odot$ <12.

Due to their peculiar spectral properties and X-ray weakness, modeling LRDs with standard AGN templates has proven challenging. In particular, the validity of single-epoch virial mass estimates in determining the black hole (BH) masses of LRDs has been called into question, with some models claiming that masses might be overestimated by up to 2 orders of magnitude, and other models claiming that LRDs may be entirely stellar in nature. We report the direct, dynamical BH mass measurement in a strongly lensed LRD at $z = 7.04$. The combination of lensing with deep spectroscopic data reveals a rotation curve that is inconsistent with a nuclear star cluster, yet can be well explained by Keplerian rotation around a point mass of 50 million Solar masses, consistent with virial BH mass estimates from the Balmer lines. The Keplerian rotation leaves little room for any stellar component in a host galaxy, as we conservatively infer $M\\_{\\rm BH}/M\\_{*}>2$. Such a ``naked'' black hole, together with its near-pristine environment, indicates that this LRD is a massive black hole seed caught in its earliest accretion phase.}",

      "abstract": "{One of the most surprising results of early James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) observations is the discovery of an abundance of red, compact, broad-line objects dubbed ``little red dots'' (LRDs) at $z>4$. Their spatial density ($\\sim10^{-4}$-$10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{cMpc^{-3}}$) is 100 times more abundant than UV-selected quasars at those redshift if one extrapolates the quasar luminosity function (QLF) down to the LRD regime. However, whether LRDs dominate black hole accretion at quasar-like luminosities ($L\\_\\mathrm{bol}rsim 10^{45-46}\\,\\mathrm{erg\\,s^{-1}}$) remains unanswered, as probing the bright end of the LRD luminosity function requires a much larger area than those able to be surveyed by JWST. In this work, we present our search for the brightest LRDs ($K<23.7$) at $4.5<z<4.9$ using wide-area multiwavelength imaging surveys from the near-UV to the infrared bands. With over 15 square degrees of sky coverage, we only identify one single LRD candidate at $z\\_\\mathrm{phot}\\approx4.6$, which translates into a spatial density of $n(M\\_{5100}<-23.5)\\approx10^{-8}\\,\\mathrm{cMpc^{-3}}$ -- this is nearly 10 times less abundant than the UV-selected quasars at similar optical luminosity. When combined with the LRD sample identified by JWST at the same redshift range, we find a sharp cutoff in the optical luminosity function at $λL\\_{5100}\\approx2.5\\times10^{44}\\,\\mathrm{erg\\,s^{-1}}$, while the QLF turnover occurs at $rsim20$ times higher luminosity. We therefore confirm the exclusively low-luminosity nature of LRDs, ruling out that LRDs are the counter parts of quasars.

      "abstract": "{We present a theoretical framework for seeding and growing supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in dark-matter halos along their assembly histories. Seeds are bred out of Pop-III stars formed during the first collapse of pristine gas in mini-halos that have reached the ${\\rm H}\\_2$-cooling limit, modulated by UV radiation from star formation and dynamical heating from fast halo assembly. Such breeding persists until the enrichment of the intergalactic medium (IGM) enables Pop-II stars to form. Post-seeding growth of black holes (BHs) is driven by distinct channels, starting with episodic super-Eddington accretion associated with nuclear bursts induced by global disturbances of galaxies, followed by sustained sub-Eddington accretion via capturing sub-clouds formed in self-gravitating gas clouds (SGCs) in halos of fast assembly, and ending with merger-dominated, quiescent growth. We implement the model in subhalo merger trees to build a coherent framework to follow the SMBH-galaxy-halo co-evolution over their full lives in the full structure hierarchy. BH seeds are bred with a broad mass spectrum of $M\\_{\\rm BH} = 10$--$10^5\\,{\\rm M}\\_\\odot$ at $z \\approx 20$--$30$ in mini-halos with masses of $10^5$--$10^8\\,{\\rm M}\\_\\odot$. Nuclear bursts provide the key condition for seeds to grow into SMBHs. The $M\\_{\\rm BH}$-$M\\_*$ relation is a multi-piece, redshift-dependent function shaped by the interplay among different growth channels. Our model predictions are broadly consistent with existing observations; especially, a population of BHs reminiscent of `little red dots' (LRDs) discovered by JWST naturally results from the seeding and growing processes.

These sources, dubbed ``Little Red Dots'' or LRDs, have been the subject of intense inquiry in the literature. Any of the proposed explanations, from accreting super-massive black holes ensconced in ultra-dense gas to extremely compact star-systems, has significant implications for the earliest phases of galaxy evolution. Part of the difficulty in concretely identifying the physical mechanisms that drive their rest ultra-violet/optical spectral properties is the lack of bona fide signatures -- either star-formation or accreting super-massive black hole, that uniquely discriminate between competing interpretations. In this work, we report the discovery of several spectral features that strongly favor the existence of an accreting super-massive black hole in an LRD witnessed in the first 800 Myr of cosmic time, including several rare iron transitions and a possible [FeVII]. Additionally, we report on the properties of significant Balmer absorption and find that the small widths and relative depths of the absorption feature suggest the source of the absorber is at or beyond the outer edge of the broad-line region and does it fully cover the accreting SMBH in the center of the system. The detection of these iron features, coupled with the properties of the Balmer absorption, unveils an alternative scenario for LRDs -- one where there are direct sight-lines from the accretion disk to gas on scales at (or beyond) the broad-line gas region.}",

      "abstract": "{The origin of the rest-optical emission of compact, red, high-redshift sources known as little red dots (LRDs) poses a major puzzle. If interpreted as starlight, it would imply that LRDs constitute the densest stellar systems in the Universe. However, alternative models suggest active galactic nuclei (AGN) may instead power the rest-optical continuum. Here, we present JWST/NIRSpec, NIRCam, and MIRI observations from the RUBIES and PRIMER programs of The Cliff: a bright LRD at z = 3.55 with an exceptional Balmer break, twice as strong as that of any high- redshift source previously observed. The spectra also reveal broad hydrogen (H{\\ensuremath{\\alpha}} FWHM {\\ensuremath{\\sim}} 1500 km s$^{‑1}$) and He I emission, but no significant metal lines. We demonstrate that massive evolved stellar populations cannot explain the observed spectrum, even when considering unusually steep and strong dust attenuation or reasonable variations in the initial mass function. Moreover, the formally best-fit stellar mass and compact size (M$\\_{*}$ {\\ensuremath{\\sim}} 10$^{10.5}$ M$\\_{{\\ensuremath{\\odot}}}$, r$\\_{e}$ {\\ensuremath{\\sim}} 40 pc) would imply densities at which near-monthly stellar collisions might lead to significant X-ray emission. We argue that the Balmer break, emission lines, and H{\\ensuremath{\\alpha}} absorption line are instead most plausibly explained by a black hole star (BH$^{*}$) scenario, in which dense gas surrounds a powerful ionising source. In contrast to recently proposed BH$^{*}$ models of dust-reddened AGN, we show that spectral fits in the rest UV to near-infrared favour an intrinsically redder continuum over strong dust reddening. This may point to a super-Eddington accreting massive black hole or, possibly, the presence of (super)massive stars in a nuclear star cluster. The Cliff is the clearest evidence to date that at least some LRDs are not ultra-dense massive galaxies, and are instead powered by a central ionising source embedded in dense, absorbing gas.}",

The simulations span a range of accretion rates, two black hole spins, and two magnetic field topologies, and include resolution studies as well as comparisons with non-radiative models. Super-Eddington accretion flows consistently develop geometrically thick disks supported by radiation pressure, regardless of magnetic field configuration. Radiation generated in the inner disk drives substantial outflows, forming conical funnel regions that limit photon escape and result in very low radiation efficiency. The accretion flows are highly turbulent with thermal energy transport dominated by radiation advection rather than diffusion. Angular momentum is primarily carried outward by Maxwell stress, with turbulent Reynolds stress playing a subdominant role. Both strong and weak jets are produced. Strong jets arise from sufficient net vertical magnetic flux and rapid black hole spin and can effectively evacuate the funnel, enabling radiation to escape through strong geometric beaming. In contrast, weak jets fail to clear the funnel, which becomes obscured by radiation-driven outflows and leads to distinct observational signatures. Spiral structures are observed in the plunging region, behaving like density waves. These super- Eddington models are applicable to a variety of astronomical systems, including ultraluminous X-ray sources, little red dots, and black hole transients.}",

If LRDs are AGN-dominated, our sample exhibits bolometric luminosities {\\ensuremath{\\sim}}10$^{45‑47}$ erg s$^{‑1}$, spanning the gap between JWST AGNs in the literature and bright, rare quasars.

However, the lack of observed far-infrared (FIR) emission has proved difficult to reconcile with the implied attenuated luminosity in these models. Here, we utilize deep new Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array imaging, new and existing JWST/MIRI imaging, and archival Spitzer/Herschel imaging of two of the rest-optically brightest LRDs (z = 3.1 and z = 4.47) to place the strongest constraints on the IR luminosity in LRDs to date.

Assuming energy balance, these observations are inconsistent with the typical FIR dust emission of dusty starbursts and quasar tori, which usually show a mixture of cold and hot dust. Additionally, our [C II] nondetections rule out typical dusty starbursts.

      "abstract": "{The birth of seeds of massive black holes (BHs) and nascent galaxies at cosmic dawn takes place in dense gaseous environments, which play a crucial role in shaping their coevolution and radiation spectra. We investigate gas accretion during the assembly of massive halos with $M\\_{\\rm h}rsim 10^{10-11}\\textasciitilde M\\_\\odot$ at redshifts $z\\simeq 4-10$, driving both rapid BH feeding and concurrent nuclear starbursts. As the BH grows to $\\sim 10^{6-7}\\textasciitilde M\\_\\odot$ via super-Eddington accretion, the accretion power inflates a dense envelope whose effective temperature approaches the Hayashi limit at $T\\_{\\rm eff}\\simeq 5000\\textasciitilde {\\rm K}$, producing red optical emission, while a coeval young stellar population of $\\sim 10^7\\textasciitilde M\\_\\odot$ provides blue UV emission. This early coevolving system naturally reproduces the characteristic spectral features of the so-called little red dots (LRDs), a population of broad-line active galactic nuclei (AGNs), including the V-shaped UV-to-optical spectra and weakness of X-ray, infrared, and radio emission. Massive stars in the nuclear starburst soon explode as supernovae, injecting energy and momentum that expel gas from the nucleus, quench gas supply to the BH envelope, and ultimately drive a transition into normal AGN phases. For individual LRDs, the optical-to-UV luminosity ratio remains nearly constant at $L\\_{\\rm opt}/L\\_{\\rm UV}\\simeq 2-10$ from the onset of accretion bursts for $\\simeq 15\\textasciitilde {\\rm Myr}$, one-third of the Salpeter time, until quenching by stellar feedback. While this ratio is sustained for the LRD population at $z\\simeq 4-8$, it declines toward lower redshifts as BHs can no longer maintain red envelopes, thereby losing the LRD characteristics.}",

The extremely compact morphology of LRDs is often invoked to point towards an AGN-dominated picture in the context of their conflicting multiwavelength properties. In this work, we assess the capability of pysersic and GALFIT -- commonly used tools in LRD morphological studies -- to recover input parameters for a simulated suite of LRD-like objects in the F444W band. We find that: 1) these tools have difficulty recovering input parameters for simulated images with SNR $\\lesssim 25$; 2) estimated PSF fraction could be a more robust physically-motivated description of LRD compactness; and 3) almost all permutations of modeled LRDs with SNR $\\lesssim 50$ cannot be differentiated from a point source, regardless of intrinsic extent. This has serious implications on how we interpret morphological results for increasingly large photometric samples of LRDs, especially at extremely high-$z$ or in relatively shallow fields. We present results of Sersic and two-component fitting to a sample of observed LRDs to compare with our mock sample fitting. We find that $\\sim85\\%$ of observed LRDs are PSF-dominated, consistent with the AGN- dominated interpretation. The remaining $\\sim15\\%$ have low estimated PSF fractions (two-component fit) and sizes $rsim 150$ pc (Sersic). This morphological diversity of LRDs suggests that that the population likely is not homogeneous. It possibly has a primary subset of sources consistent with the AGN-dominated hypothesis, and a secondary population of sources more consistent with arising perhaps from extremely compact starbursts.}",

The nature of LRDs is controversial. Recently, several studies have investigated LRDs through variability, a characteristic feature of AGNs. These studies explore LRD variability by extrapolating empirical relationships from local quasars. Here, we adopt the Corona-heated Accretion- disk Reprocessing (CHAR) model, which is motivated by accretion physics and is applicable to reproducing AGN conventional variability, to study the variability of 22 LRDs in W. L. Tee et al. Our results indicate that the observed variability in LRDs is dominated by measurement uncertainties. Within the CHAR model, the lack of variability in LRDs can be explained by two scenarios: either AGNs contribute {\\ensuremath{\\lesssim}}30\\% of the observed luminosities, or they are intrinsically luminous AGNs. We use simulations to demonstrate the observational requirements to effectively investigate LRDs via variability with the following criteria: first, the sample has about 200 LRDs; second, each LRD has two observations separated by at least 2 yr in the observed frame; third, the photometric uncertainty is {\\ensuremath{\\leq}}0.07 mag.

A cocoon of dense excited gas is emerging as key component to explain the most striking properties of LRDs, such as strong Balmer breaks and Balmer absorption, as well as the weak IR emission. To dissect the structure of LRDs, we analyze new deep JWST/NIRSpec PRISM and G395H spectra of FRESCO-GN-9771, one of the most luminous known LRDs at $z=5.5$. These reveal a strong Balmer break, broad Balmer lines and very narrow [O III] emission. We unveil a forest of optical [Fe II] lines, which we argue is emerging from a dense ($n\\_{\\rm H}=10^{9-10}$ cm$^{-3}$) warm layer with electron temperature $T\\_{\\rm e}\\approx7000$ K. The broad wings of H$α$ and H$β$ have an exponential profile due to electron scattering in this same layer. The high $\\rm Hα:Hβ:Hγ$ flux ratio of $\\approx10.4:1:0.14$ is an indicator of collisional excitation and resonant scattering dominating the Balmer line emission. A narrow H$γ$ component, unseen in the other two Balmer lines due to outshining by the broad components, could trace the ISM of a normal host galaxy with a star formation rate $\\sim5$ M$\\_{\\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$. The warm layer is mostly opaque to Balmer transitions, producing a characteristic P-Cygni profile in the line centers suggesting outflowing motions. This same layer is responsible for shaping the Balmer break. The broad-band spectrum can be reasonably matched by a simple photoionized slab model that dominates the $λ>1500$ {\\r{A}} continuum and a low mass ($\\sim10^8$ M$\\_{\\odot}$) galaxy that could explain the narrow [O III], with only subdominant contribution to the UV continuum. Our findings indicate that Balmer lines are not directly tracing gas kinematics near the SMBH and that the BH mass scale is likely much lower than virial indicators suggest.}",

      "abstract": "{We present the deepest medium-resolution JWST/NIRSpec spectroscopy to date of a bright Little Red Dot (LRD) AGN, Irony at z=6.68. The data reveal broad Balmer emission from H$α$-H$δ$ and Balmer absorption in H$α$-H$ε$. The absorption lines are kinematically split: H$α$ is blueshifted while higher-order lines are redshifted suggesting complex gas kinematics; their relative ratios are inconsistent with a single, passive absorbing screen. The line depths require absorption of both the BLR and the continuum, ruling out a stellar origin, consistent with the smooth Balmer break. We fit the broad H$γ$-H$α$ lines and find the data favor a double-Gaussian effective profile, although exponential wings are evident. Depending on the adopted profile, single-epoch virial estimates give log(M$\\_\\bullet$/M$\\_\\odot$)=7.86-8.39 and $λ\\_{\\rm Edd}$=1.7-0.4. The dynamical mass implied by the narrow lines is low log(Mdyn/M$\\_\\odot$)=9.1, suggesting an overmassive black hole. The narrow lines display little attenuation, A$\\_V<0.5$ mag; while broad H$α$/H$β\\sim9$ and the broad Balmer decrements are inconsistent with standard dust attenuation curves, suggesting collisional processes. The forbidden-line spectrum includes auroral [S II] and [N II], and a forest of [Fe II] lines. Line ratios and kinematics indicate a stratified narrow-line region with both low (n$\\_{\\rm e}$=420 cm$^{-3}$) and high densities (n$\\_{\\rm e}rsim 6.3\\times10^5$ cm$^{-3}$). We detect metal absorption lines in both the optical (Ca II and Na I) and UV range (Fe II UV1-UV3). Our results support a picture of a compact AGN embedded in a dense, high covering-factor and stratified cocoon, with complex neutral-gas kinematics. While the choice of broad-line profile affects the virial estimates of M$\\_\\bullet$, we find the effect to be of order 0.6 dex between the different approaches.}",

While this may indicate a weaker UV ionizing spectrum in many z > 4 active galactic nuclei or obscuration from dense neutral gas and dust, the complete picture remains unclear owing to the small number of deep rest-UV spectra. Here, we characterize the strength of high-ionization lines in 53 new galaxies observed with NIRSpec R = 2700 grating spectroscopy.

One is a previously confirmed z = 6.98 little red dot (LRD) with broad H{\\ensuremath{\\beta}}, and the other is a z = 8.72 galaxy with a narrow-line spectrum. Neither source exhibits C IV or He II emission, indicating large N V/C IV and N V/He II ratios that may reflect a combination of nitrogen-enhancement and resonant scattering effects. We investigate the incidence of narrow high- ionization lines in a large database of 851 NIRSpec grating spectra, and we separately quantify the fraction of LRDs with narrow high-ionization UV emission lines. Our results likely suggest that hard radiation fields are indeed present in a small subset of LRDs (12.5‑10.4+23.7\\%) and UV-selected galaxies (2.2‑1.0+1.7\\%) at z > 4. The identification of narrow high- ionization lines in the population of LRDs with strong Balmer absorption suggests that the dense neutral hydrogen gas may not uniformly cover the nucleus. The strong N V (coupled with weak C IV and He II) suggests that efforts to identify high-ionization lines should extend down in wavelength to the N V doublet.}",

Photometric surveys at lower redshift have recently been carried out to trace their evolution across cosmic time, and a small number of LRDs have been spectroscopically identified at both Cosmic Noon and in the local universe.

The GMOS data reveal extended blue emission from starburst with a star formation rate of 400 Msun yr-1, together with an extended, highly fast ionized outflow. This is the first spectroscopic confirmation of extended host emission and outflow in an LRD- like galaxy, providing a unique laboratory for understanding the nature of their high-redshift counterparts. Moreover, J2048 would host an extremely overmassive BH with a BH-to-stellar mass ratio of 0.6, with the BH mass and host stellar mass estimated to be 10\\^10.2 and 10\\^10.4 Msun, respectively.

      "abstract": "{Little Red Dots (LRDs) are a new class of compact extragalactic objects, with a v-shaped optical spectral energy distribution breaking close to the Balmer break wavelength, and broad, typically exponentially-shaped lines. They are believed to be supermassive black holes surrounded by very dense, ionized gas, leading us to explore for any departures from Case B recombination by examining the ratios of multiple hydrogen Balmer lines: $Hα$, $Hβ$, $Hγ$, and $Hδ$. We analyze a dozen high-S/N LRDs with JWST/NIRSpec, measuring Balmer ratios in the seven objects with coverage of at least three lines. We decompose the line ratios into their respective broad and narrow components. Broad line ratios are consistent with Case B plus dust extinction in all objects but one, RUBIES EGS-49140, which departs from Case B expectations by more than $5σ$. The narrow components are consistent with minimal dust attenuation, while two objects exhibit narrow $Hα$/$Hβ\\approx 1.8$. Such low decrements are observed in highly ionized density bounded nebulae, associated with starburst environments. Nevertheless, both flat decrement cases can be reconciled assuming an unresolved absorption feature. RUBIES EGS-49140, shows a high broad $Hα$/$Hβ$, but $Hγ$/$Hα$ and $Hδ$/$Hα$ ratios are lower than expected for extinction-modified Case B, hinting at an unphysically steep dust law. These line ratios may be due to increased optical depth in the Balmer lines, as a direct effect of high density (log$n\\_e$ > 9) gas surrounding the black hole. If Case B recombination does hold in most LRDs, they must be moderate-to- heavily dust obscured ($A\\_V\\simeq1-8$) while the host-galaxy should be dust-free, suggesting that the extinction in the broad lines is local to the LRD and not due to the general ISM of the host galaxy.}",

      "abstract": "{Astronomical research has long relied on human expertise to interpret complex data and formulate scientific hypotheses. In this study, we introduce Mephisto -- a multi-agent collaboration framework powered by large language models (LLMs) that emulates human-like reasoning for analyzing multi-band galaxy observations. Mephisto interfaces with the CIGALE codebase (a library of spectral energy distribution, SED, models) to iteratively refine physical models against observational data. It conducts deliberate reasoning via tree search, accumulates knowledge through self- play, and dynamically updates its knowledge base. Validated across diverse galaxy populations -- including the James Webb Space Telescope's recently discovered ``Little Red Dot'' galaxies -- we show that Mephisto demonstrates proficiency in inferring the physical properties of galaxies from multi-band photometry, positioning it as a promising research copilot for astronomers. Unlike prior black-box machine learning approaches in astronomy, Mephisto offers a transparent, human-aligned reasoning process that integrates seamlessly with existing research practices. This work underscores the possibility of LLM-driven agent-based research for astronomy, establishes a foundation for fully automated, end-to-end artificial intelligence (AI)-powered scientific workflows, and unlocks new avenues for AI-augmented discoveries in astronomy.}",

      "abstract": "{JWST has identified a large population of faint, broad-line active galactic nuclei (AGN) in the early universe that are powered by black holes (BHs) that often appear overmassive relative to their host galaxies. In this study, we examine the relationship between BH mass and galaxy stellar mass at $3<z<7$ using a sample of 70 broad-line AGN identified using NIRSpec/G395M spectroscopy from the CEERS, JADES, and RUBIES surveys. Roughly half (43\\textbackslash\\%) of our sample appear heavily reddened and are classified as little red dots (LRDs). We estimate BH masses ($M\\_{\\rm BH}$) using single-epoch virial techniques, while host stellar masses ($M\\_{\\star}$) are inferred using a combination of two-dimensional surface brightness profile fitting and spectral energy distribution modeling. We find that a majority of our sources (50/70) have $M\\_{\\rm BH}/M\\_{\\star}$ ratios that are 1-2 dex higher than that observed in AGN locally. Using a forward-modeling Bayesian framework that accounts for uncertainties, intrinsic scatter, and selection effects, we infer a $M\\_{\\rm BH}-M\\_{\\star}$ relationship that is $>3σ$ above the relationship measured for local broad-line AGN. We derive an intrinsic scatter in this relationship of $0.9$ dex, which does not vary over the redshift range of our sample. We also find that the $M\\_{\\rm BH}/M\\_{\\star}$ ratio increases by $2.3$ dex from $z = 3.5$ and $z = 6.5$ with a confidence level of $ > 3σ$. We attribute this trend with the increasing fraction of LRDs in our sample at $z>4$ as their host masses are $\\sim1$ dex lower than the non-LRD AGN in our sample. These results support a picture in which the BHs powering JWST's broad-line AGN are genuinely overmassive and become increasingly so with redshift. We discuss the implications of our findings on early BH growth relative to that of their host galaxies and the constraints it places on BH seeding models.}",

Photometric samples were constructed from varying selection criteria with limited spectroscopic follow-up available to test intrinsic spectral shapes and the prevalence of broad emission lines. We used the RUBIES survey, a large spectroscopic program with wide color-morphology coverage and homogeneous data quality, to systematically analyze the emission-line kinematics, spectral shapes, and morphologies of {\\ensuremath{\\sim}}1500 galaxies at z > 3.1. We identified broad Balmer lines via a novel fitting approach that simultaneously models NIRSpec/PRISM and G395M spectra, yielding 80 broad-line sources with 28 (35\\%) at z > 6. A large subpopulation naturally emerged from the broad Balmer line sources, with 36 exhibiting v-shaped UV-to-optical continua and a dominant point source component in the rest-optical; we define these as spectroscopic LRDs, constituting the largest such sample to date. Strikingly, the spectroscopic LRD population is largely recovered when either a broad line or rest-optical point source is required in combination with a v-shaped continuum, suggesting an inherent link between these three defining characteristics. We compared the spectroscopic LRD sample to published photometric searches. Although these selections have high accuracy, 80\\%‑95\\% down to F444W < 26.5, only 50\\%‑80\\% of the RUBIES LRDs were photometrically identified, depending on the selection criteria used.

      "abstract": "{Little red dots (LRDs), newly identified compact and dusty galaxies with an unexpectedly high number density observed by JWST, have an unusual ``V-shaped'' rest-frame UV to near-infrared spectral energy distribution (SED). A group of hyperluminous, obscured quasars with excess blue emission, called blue-excess hot dust- obscured galaxies (BHDs), also exhibit qualitatively similar SEDs to those of LRDs. They represent a rare population of galaxies hosting supermassive black holes (SMBHs) accreting near the Eddington limit at redshifts z {\\ensuremath{\\sim}} 1{\\textendash}4. In this study, we compare their multiwavelength SEDs to investigate whether LRDs, or a subset of them, could be high-redshift analogs of BHDs. Our analysis reveals that despite their similar ``V-shape'' SEDs, LRDs appear to be a different population than BHDs. The ``V-shape'' of BHDs appears at longer wavelengths compared to LRDs due to different selection strategies, suggesting LRDs have much less dust attenuation than typical BHDs. The bluer colors in the rest-frame infrared (continuum) emission of LRDs suggest the absence of hot dust heated by active galactic nuclei (AGN) accretion activities. We also argue that the blue excess in LRDs is unlikely from AGN scattered light. The compact morphologies and lower X-ray detection frequencies of LRDs suggest a distinct formation pathway from BHDs, which are thought to be powered by super- Eddington accretion onto central SMBHs following major galaxy mergers.}",

      "abstract": "{We present a novel formation channel for supermassive black hole (SMBH) binaries in the early Universe, driven by primordial black holes (PBHs). Using high-resolution hydrodynamical simulations, we explore the role of massive PBHs (m$\\_{BH}$ {\\ensuremath{\\sim}} {}10$^{6}$ M$\\_{{\\ensuremath{\\odot}}}$) in catalyzing the formation of direct-collapse black holes (DCBHs), providing a natural in situ pathway for binary SMBH formation. PBHs enhance local overdensities, accelerate structure formation, and exert thermal feedback on the surrounding medium via accretion.

We analyze the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of 88 LRDs from the JWST PRIMER survey with complete photometric coverage from 1 to 18 {\\ensuremath{\\mu}}m using NIRCam and MIRI imaging, representing the most extensive SED analysis on a large LRD sample with long-wavelength MIRI data. We examine SED models in which either galaxy or active galactic nucleus (AGN) emission dominates the rest-frame UV or optical continuum, extracting physical properties to explore each scenario's implications. In the galaxy-only model, we find massive, dusty stellar populations alongside unobscured, low- mass components, hinting at inhomogeneous obscuration. The AGN- only model indicates dusty, luminous AGNs with low hot dust fractions compared to typical quasars. A hybrid AGN and galaxy model suggests low-mass, unobscured galaxies in the UV, with stellar mass estimates spanning {\\ensuremath{\\sim}}2 dex across the different models, underscoring the need for caution in interpreting LRD stellar masses. With MIRI photometry, the galaxy-only model produces stellar masses within cosmological limits, but extremely high stellar mass densities are inferred. The hybrid model infers highly overmassive black holes exceeding those in recently reported high-redshift AGNs, hinting at a partial AGN contribution to the rest-optical continuum or widespread super-Eddington accretion. Our findings highlight the extreme conditions required for both AGN- and galaxy-dominated scenarios in LRDs, supporting a mixed contribution to the red continuum, or novel scenarios to explain the observed emission.}",

We present the results of SED analysis with multiwavelength photometric data and spectroscopic analysis, observed with Gemini-S/GMOS, FLAMINGOS-2, to explore the origin of blue-excess emission of a hyperluminous BlueDOG, ADFS-KMTDOG-102, at z = 2.6. The SED analysis shows that this BlueDOG is a highly massive system (log M$\\_{*}$/M$\\_{{\\ensuremath{\\odot}}}$ = 12.3) with substantial extinction. Additionally, the proportion of the old stellar population exceeds that of the young stellar population, which suggests stellar evolution cumulated from the early Universe.

We discuss the similarity between the BlueDOG and ``Little Red Dots'' (LRDs), recently discovered with the James Webb Space Telescope, showing SED shapes remarkably similar to those of LRDs. The UV emission line ratios indicate that the emission lines are primarily powered by the central active galactic nuclei (AGN).

Using orbit-based dynamical models, we model Segue 1, including a dark halo and a central black hole. The best-fit model requires a black hole mass of 4.5 {\\ensuremath{\\pm}} 1.5 {\\texttimes} {}10$^{5}$ M$\\_{{\\ensuremath{\\odot}}}$. The value of the black hole mass is similar either with or without a dark halo. The mass-to-light ratio of the stars is poorly constrained by the dynamical modeling, reflecting that Segue 1 is dominated by mass other than stars. Dynamical models that exclude a black hole provide a worse fit and require a dark halo with very-small-scale radii of below 100 pc. Additionally, the zero black hole models require a stellar orbital distribution that is highly radially biased. The model with a black hole provides an orbital structure that is close to isotropic, more similar to other well-studied systems. We argue that the two-parameter models of stars and black hole provide a better description of Segue 1 than the three-parameter models of stars and two dark halo components. Additional support for a central black hole comes from a significant increase in the central rotation. Using individual velocities, we measure a rotation amplitude of 9.0 {\\ensuremath{\\pm}} 2.4 km s$^{‑1}$.

      "title": "{What Do Radio Emission Constraints Tell Us About Little Red Dots as Tidal Disruption Events?}",
      "abstract": "{The real nature of little red dots (LRDs), a class of very compact galaxies in the early Universe recently discovered by the James Webb Space Telescope, is still poorly understood. The most popular theories competing to interpret the phenomena include active galactic nuclei and enhanced star formation in dusty galaxies. To date, however, neither model gives a completely satisfactory explanation to the population as a whole; thus, alternative theories have arisen, including tidal disruption events (TDEs). By considering observational constraints on the radio emission of LRDs, we discuss whether TDEs are adequate alternatives solving these high-redshift enigmas. We utilise radio flux density upper limits from LRD stacking analyses, TDE peak radio luminosities, and volumetric density estimates. We find that the characteristic values of flux densities and luminosities allow radio-quiet TDEs as the underlying process of LRDs in any case, while the less common radio-loud TDEs are compatible with the model under special constraints only. Considering other factors, such as volumetric density estimates, delayed and long-term radio flares of TDEs, and cosmological time dilation, TDEs appear to be a plausible explanation for LRDs from the radio point of view.}",

      "abstract": "{JWST has revealed a population of red, compact, high-redshift (${z\\sim3-10}$) objects referred to as ``Little Red Dots`` (LRDs). These objects exhibit unusual spectral features reminiscent of stellar spectra with blackbody-like SEDs, large hydrogen Balmer breaks, Balmer line absorption, and classical stellar absorption features such as calcium H\\&K and the calcium triplet. Following the recent suggestion that these may be actively accreting direct-collapse black holes in the process of assembly, i.e. quasi-stars, we present evolutionary models of quasi-stars using our recently released, publicly available MESA-QUEST modeling framework. We compute a grid of models spanning a range of black hole masses and predict the luminosities, temperatures, surface gravities, and lifetimes of these objects. We find that these models lie along a Hayashi track once they hit their ``late-stage'' which constitutes the majority of their lives ($\\sim 20$\\raisebox{-0.5ex}\\textasciitildeMyr). We present scaling relations for estimating the mass of a quasi-star as a function of the bolometric luminosity, as well as the bolometric luminosity as a function of the effective temperature for the Hayashi track. The short lifetimes in tandem with the observed number density of LRDs imply the possibility that every supermassive black hole was once a quasi-star. We compare synthetic spectra of our quasi-star models to observations of LRDs, and show that these models are broadly capable of reproducing the continuum spectra of observed LRDs. These results indicate that quasi-stars are promising candidates for the origin of supermassive black holes via direct collapse in the early universe.}",

We present analysis of Balmer absorption in a sample of 14 iron low-ionization BAL quasars (FeLoBALQs); eight are new identifications. We measured velocity offset, width, and apparent optical depth. The partial covering that is ubiquitous in BAL quasar spectra alters the measured Balmer optical depth ratios; accounting for this, we estimated the true H(n = 2) column density. We found the anticipated correlation between Eddington ratio and outflow speed, but it is weak in this sample because nearly all of the objects have the low outflow speeds characterizing loitering outflow FeLoBAL quasars, objects that are also found to have low accretion rates. Measurements of dN/dv, the differential column density with respect to the outflow speed, are anticorrelated with the luminosity and Eddington ratio: the strongest absorption is observed at the lowest speeds in the lowest-luminosity objects. The absorption line width is correlated with {\\ensuremath{\\alpha}}$\\_{oi}$, the F$\\_{{\\ensuremath{\\lambda}}}$ point-to-point slope between 5100 {\\r{A}} and 3 {\\ensuremath{\\mu}}m. This parameter is strongly correlated with the Eddington ratio among low-redshift quasars. BALs have been recently found in the spectra of little red dots (LRDs), a class of high-redshift objects discovered by JWST.

      "abstract": "{We present a multiwavelength spectroscopic survey of 23 luminous mid- infrared-selected Type-2 quasars at the redshifts of ─3.49. The targets were selected in the SDSS Stripe 82 field based on their bright WISE 22 m detections and extremely faint or red optical counterparts. Near-infrared (Gemini/Gemini Near-InfraRed Spectrograph) and optical (Keck/Low Resolution Imaging Spectrometer and Keck Cosmic Web Imager Integral Field Spectrograph) spectroscopy confirm 23 out of 24 candidates as Type-2 quasars, including 12 objects at . The spectra exhibit strong rest-frame UV and optical emission lines (Ly , C IV, [O III], H ) with a wide range of line widths, indicating significant spectral diversity. Approximately one-third of the sample (8 of 23) shows broad H emission (full width at half- maximum, FWHM km s) despite their Type-2 classification, while the rest have only narrow lines (FWHM km s) characteristic of classical obscured quasars. Notably, these broad-line Type-2 quasars share similar spectral energy distributions with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST)-discovered 'little red dot', suggesting that our sample could be lower redshift analogues of the heavily obscured broad-line AGNs uncovered by JWST. We also find that the [O III] 5007 emission is relatively weak for their high-bolometric luminosities, deviating from trends seen in lower-z Type-2 quasi-stellar objects (QSOs). A new composite spectrum for Type-2 QSOs is built using our sample. Overall, our results demonstrate that mid-infrared selection efficiently uncovers diverse populations of obscured quasars and that spectroscopic follow-up is crucial for revealing their true nature. This study provides new insights into heavily obscured supermassive black hole growth at cosmic noon and bridges the gap to the obscured active galactic nuclei populations being revealed by JWST.}",

      "abstract": "{We address the origin of the Little Red Dots (LRDs) seen by JWST at cosmic morning ($z \\!=\\! 4 \\!-\\! 8$) as compact stellar systems with over-massive black holes (BHs). We propose that LRDs form naturally after feedback-free starbursts (FFB) in thousands of star clusters and following wet compaction. Analytically, we show how the clusters enable efficient dry migration of stars and BHs to the galaxy center by two-body segregation and dynamical friction against the disk. The clusters merge to form compact central clusters as observed. Mutual tidal stripping does not qualitatively affect the analysis. The young, rotating clusters are natural sites for the formation of BH seeds via rapid core collapse. The migrating clusters carry the BH seeds, which merge into central super-massive BHs (SMBHs). Compactions are required to deepen the potential wells such that the SMBHs are retained after post-merger gravitational-wave recoils, locked to the galaxy centers. Using cosmological simulations at different epochs, with different codes and physical recipes, we evaluate the additional growth of LRD-matching compact central stellar systems by global compaction events. Adding to the dry growth by cluster mergers, the compactions can increase the escape velocities to retain the SMBHs. The LRDs appear at $z \\!\\sim\\! 8$, after the formation of FFB clusters, and disappear after $z \\!\\sim\\! 4$ when the stellar mass is above $10^9 M\\_\\odot$ by growing post-compaction blue disks around the nuclear LRDs.

      "abstract": "{The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) begun to revolutionize our view of the Cosmos. The discovery of Blue Monsters (i.e. ultracompact yet very bright high-z galaxies) and the Little Red Dots (i.e. very compact dustless strong Balmer break cosmic dawn sources) pose significant challenges to pre-JWST era models of the assembly of first stars and galaxies. In addition, JWST data further strengthen the problem posed by the origin of the supermassive black holes that power the most distant quasars observed. Stars powered by Dark Matter annihilation (i.e. Dark Stars) can form out of primordial gas clouds during the cosmic dawn era and subsequently might grow via accretion and become supermassive. In this paper we argue that Supermassive Dark Stars (SMDSs) offer natural solutions to the three puzzles mentioned above. Moreover, we present the best evidence so far, for the existence of SMDSs: the identification of a He\\raisebox{ -0.5ex}\\textasciitildeII$λ$2511\\raisebox{-0.5ex}\\textasciitilde{ \\r{A}} absorption feature at $S/N\\sim4$ in the spectrum of JADES-GS-z13-0.}",

      "abstract": "{As an unprecedented large population in the early universe, the JWST- discovered little red dots (LRDs) have garnered much attention for formation of massive black holes and galaxies, but their nature remains a mystery. The LRDs appearing as ``Chimeras'' like both active galactic nuclei (AGNs) and galaxies have stimulated renewed interest in the roadmap of central massive black hole (cMBH) formation in AGNs. In this paper, we suggest that the LRDs contain $M\\_{\\bullet}\\lesssim 10^6\\,M\\_{\\odot}$ cMBHs as demonstrated by the So{\\l}tan argument and there is a large population of stellar-mass black holes (sMBHs with total mass of $\\mathscr{M}\\_{m\\_{\\bullet}}$) embedded inside cMBH accretion disks (cMBH-disk) as motivated by anomalous reverberations of broad H$β$ line in local AGNs. This embryo structure of LRDs ($M\\_{\\bullet}<\\mathscr{M}\\_{m\\_{\\bullet}}$) is formed as a consequence of gravitational collapse of primordial clouds. In this Chimera, accretion onto sMBHs powers the rest- frame optical continuum of the LRDs but the UV continuum is jointly contributed by slim parts of the cMBH-disks and nuclear starbursts in the core of collapsing clouds governing the appearance of the observed V-shaped spectral energy distributions (SEDs). Outflowing clumped-envelopes are unavoidably formed by radiation pressure leading to absorption features of the Balmer lines. The present model works very well for LRDs' SEDs and avoids the issues of overly massive cMBHs. Evolution of LRDs is briefly discussed including gravitational waves.}",
