      "abstract": "{Recent observations have found a large number of supermassive black holes already in place in the first few hundred million years after the Big Bang, many of which seem to be overmassive relative to their host galaxy stellar mass when compared with local relation$^{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8{\\textendash}9}$. Several different models have been proposed to explain these findings, ranging from heavy seeds to light seeds experiencing bursts of high accretion rate$^{10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15{\\textendash}16}$. Yet, current datasets are unable to differentiate between these various scenarios. Here we report the detection, from the JADES survey, of broad H{\\ensuremath{\\alpha}} emission in a galaxy at z = 6.68, which traces a black hole with a mass of about 4 {\\texttimes} {}10$^{8}$M$\\_{{\\ensuremath{\\odot}}}$ and accreting at a rate of only 0.02 times the Eddington limit. The black hole to host galaxy stellar mass ratio is about 0.4{\\textemdash}that is, about 1,000 times above the local relation{\\textemdash}whereas the system is closer to the local relations in terms of dynamical mass and velocity dispersion of the host galaxy. This object is most likely an indication of a much larger population of dormant black holes around the epoch of reionization. Its properties are consistent with scenarios in which short bursts of super-Eddington accretion have resulted in black hole overgrowth and massive gas expulsion from the accretion disk; in between bursts, black holes spend most of their life in a dormant state.}",

      "abstract": "{Deep observations with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) have revealed an emerging population of red pointlike sources that could provide a link between the postulated supermassive black hole seeds and observed quasars. In this work, we present a JWST/NIRSpec spectrum from the JWST Cycle 1 UNCOVER Treasury survey of a massive accreting black hole at z = 8.50 displaying a clear broad-line component as inferred from the H{\\ensuremath{\\beta}} line with FWHM = 3439 {\\ensuremath{\\pm}} 413 km s$^{-1}$, typical of the broad-line region of an active galactic nucleus (AGN). The AGN nature of this object is further supported by high ionization, as inferred from emission lines, and a point-source morphology. We compute a black hole mass of ${\\mathrm{log}}\\_{10}({M}\\_{\\mathrm{BH}}/{M}\\_{\\odot })=8.17\\pm 0.42$ and a bolometric luminosity of L $\\_{bol}$ \\raisebox{-0.5ex}\\textasciitilde 6.6 {\\texttimes} {}10$^{45}$ erg s$^{-1}$. These values imply that our object is accreting at \\raisebox{-0.5ex}\\textasciitilde40\\% of the Eddington limit. Detailed modeling of the spectral energy distribution in the optical and near-infrared, together with constraints from ALMA, indicate an upper limit on the stellar mass of ${\\mathrm{log}}\\_{10}({M}\\_{* }/{M}\\_{\\odot }) 8.7$ , which would lead to an unprecedented ratio of black hole to host mass of at least \\raisebox{-0.5ex}\\textasciitilde30\\%. This is orders of magnitude higher compared to the local QSOs but consistent with recent AGN studies at high redshift with JWST. This finding suggests that a nonnegligible fraction of supermassive black holes either started out from massive seeds and/or grew at a super-Eddington rate at high redshift. Given the predicted number densities of high-z faint AGN, future NIRSpec observations of larger samples will allow us to further investigate galaxy-black hole coevolution in the early Universe.}",

The first source, CEERS 2782 at z = 5.242, is 2{\\textendash}3 dex fainter than known quasars at similar redshifts and was previously identified as a candidate low-luminosity AGN based on its morphology and rest-frame optical spectral energy distribution (SED). We measure a BH mass of M $\\_{BH}$ = (1.3 {\\ensuremath{\\pm}} 0.4) {\\texttimes} {}10$^{7}$ M $\\_{{\\ensuremath{\\odot}}}$, confirming that this AGN is powered by the least massive BH known in the Universe at the end of cosmic reionization. The second source, CEERS 746 at z = 5.624, is inferred to be a heavily obscured, broad-line AGN caught in a transition phase between a dust-obscured starburst and an unobscured quasar.

The M $\\_{BH}$/M $\\_{{\\ensuremath{\\star}}}$ ratio for CEERS 2782, in particular, is consistent with or higher than the empirical relationship seen in massive galaxies at z = 0. We examine the narrow emission line ratios of both sources and find that their location on the BPT and OHNO diagrams is consistent with model predictions for moderately low metallicity AGNs with Z/Z $\\_{{\\ensuremath{\\odot}}}$ ≃ 0.2{\\textendash}0.4. The spectroscopic identification of low-luminosity, broad-line AGNs at z > 5 with M $\\_{BH}$ ≃ {}10$^{7}$ M $\\_{{\\ensuremath{\\odot}}}$ demonstrates the capability of JWST to push BH masses closer to the range predicted for the BH seed population and provides a unique opportunity to study the early stages of BH{\\textendash}galaxy assembly.}",

This is extended at medium depth in GOODS-S and GOODS-N with NIRCam imaging of {\\ensuremath{\\sim}}167 arcmin$^{2}$, averaging 25 hr of exposure over 8─10 filters. In both fields, we conduct extensive NIRSpec multiobject spectroscopy, including two deep pointings of 55 hr exposure time, 14 medium pointings of {\\ensuremath{\\sim}}12 hr, and 15 shallower pointings of {\\ensuremath{\\sim}}4 hr, targeting over 5000 Hubble Space Telescope─ and JWST-detected faint sources with five low-, medium-, and high-resolution dispersers covering 0.6─5.3 {\\ensuremath{\\mu}}m. Finally, JADES extends redward via coordinated parallels with the JWST Mid-Infrared Instrument, featuring {\\ensuremath{\\sim}}10 arcmin$^{2}$ with 43 hr of exposure at 7.7 {\\ensuremath{\\mu}}m and thrice that area with 1.4─6.8 hr of exposure at 12.8 and 15 {\\ensuremath{\\mu}}m. For nearly 30 yr, the GOODS-S and GOODS-N fields have been developed as the premier deep fields on the sky; JADES is now providing a compelling start on JWST's legacy in these fields.}",

This galaxy, denoted here as CEERS\\_1019, was previously discovered as a Ly{\\ensuremath{\\alpha}}-break galaxy by Hubble with a Ly{\\ensuremath{\\alpha}} redshift from Keck. As part of the Cosmic Evolution Early Release Science (CEERS) survey, we have observed this source with JWST/NIRSpec, MIRI, NIRCam, and NIRCam/WFSS and uncovered a plethora of emission lines. The H{\\ensuremath{\\beta}} line is best fit by a narrow plus a broad component, where the latter is measured at 2.5{\\ensuremath{\\sigma}} with an FWHM \\raisebox{-0.5ex}\\textasciitilde1200 km s$^{-1}$. We conclude this originates in the broadline region of an active galactic nucleus (AGN). This is supported by the presence of weak high- ionization lines (N V, N IV], and C III]), as well as a spatial point-source component. The implied mass of the black hole (BH) is log (M $\\_{BH}$/M $\\_{{\\ensuremath{\\odot}}}$) = 6.95 {\\ensuremath{\\pm}} 0.37, and we estimate that it is accreting at 1.2 {\\ensuremath{\\pm}} 0.5 times the Eddington limit. The 1-8 {\\ensuremath{\\mu}}m photometric spectral energy distribution shows a continuum dominated by starlight and constrains the host galaxy to be massive (log M/M$\\_{{\\ensuremath{\\odot}}}$ \\raisebox{-0.5ex}\\textasciitilde9.5) and highly star-forming (star formation rate, or SFR \\raisebox{-0.5ex}\\textasciitilde 30 M$\\_{{\\ensuremath{\\odot}}}$ yr$^{-1}$; log sSFR \\raisebox{-0.5ex}\\textasciitilde - 7.9 yr$^{-1}$). The line ratios show that the gas is metal-poor (Z/Z $\\_{{\\ensuremath{\\odot}}}$ \\raisebox{-0.5ex}\\textasciitilde 0.1), dense (n $\\_{ e }$ \\raisebox{-0.5ex}\\textasciitilde {}10$^{3}$ cm$^{-3}$), and highly ionized (log U \\raisebox{-0.5ex}\\textasciitilde - 2.1). We use this present highest-redshift AGN discovery to place constraints on BH seeding models and find that a combination of either super- Eddington accretion from stellar seeds or Eddington accretion from very massive BH seeds is required to form this object.}",

Understanding how massive black holes could form so early in cosmic history and affect their environment to establish the observed relations today are some of the major open questions in astrophysics and cosmology.

We use the cosmological simulation code GIZMO to study the formation and growth of DCBH seeds in the early Universe. To grow the DCBHs, we implement a gas swallowing model set to match the Eddington accretion rate as long as the nearby gaseous environment, affected by stellar and accretion disk feedback, provides sufficient fuel. We find that to create massive AGN in overmassive systems at high redshifts, massive seeds accreting more efficiently than the fiducial Bondi{\\textendash}Hoyle model are needed. We assess whether the conditions for such enhanced accretion rates are realistic by considering limits on plausible transport mechanisms. We also examine various DCBH growth histories and find that mass growth is more sustained in overdense cosmological environments, where high gas densities are achieved locally.

      "abstract": "{The identification of red, apparently massive galaxies at z > 7 in early James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) photometry suggests a strongly accelerated time line compared to standard models of galaxy growth. A major uncertainty in the interpretation is whether the red colors are caused by evolved stellar populations, dust, or other effects such as emission lines or active galactic nuclei (AGNs). Here we show that three of the massive galaxy candidates at z = 6.7{\\textendash}8.4 have prominent Balmer breaks in JWST/NIRSpec spectroscopy from the RUBIES program. The Balmer breaks demonstrate unambiguously that stellar emission dominates at {\\ensuremath{\\lambda}} $\\_{rest}$ = 0.4 {\\ensuremath{\\mu}}m and require formation histories extending hundreds of millions of years into the past in galaxies only 600{\\textendash}800 Myr after the big bang. Two of the three galaxies also show broad Balmer lines, with H{\\ensuremath{\\beta}} FWHM > 2500 km s$^{‑1}$, suggesting that dust-reddened AGNs contribute to, or even dominate, the spectral energy distributions of these galaxies at {\\ensuremath{\\lambda}} $\\_{rest}$ {\\ensuremath{\\gtrsim}} 0.6 {\\ensuremath{\\mu}}m. All three galaxies have relatively narrow [O III] lines, seemingly ruling out a high-mass interpretation if the lines arise in dynamically relaxed, inclined disks. Yet the inferred masses also remain highly uncertain. We model the high-quality spectra using Prospector to decompose the continuum into stellar and AGN components and explore limiting cases in stellar/AGN contribution. This produces a wide range of possible stellar masses, spanning M $\\_{{\\ensuremath{\\star}}}$ {\\ensuremath{\\sim}} {}10$^{9}$‑{}10$^{11}$ M $\\_{{\\ensuremath{\\odot}}}$. Nevertheless, all fits suggest a very early and rapid formation, most of which follow with a truncation in star formation.

Comparing the stellar mass $M\\_*$ and the UV-slope $\\beta$ distributions between JWST- and HST-selected samples, we generally find very good agreement and no significant biases. Nevertheless, JWST enables us to probe a new population of UV-red galaxies that was missing from previous HST-based Lyman-break galaxy (LBG) samples. We measure galaxy stellar mass functions (SMFs) at $z\\sim 4\\!-\\!9$ down to limiting masses of $10^{7.5}\\!-\\!10^{8.5}\\, {\\rm M\\_\\odot }$, finding steep low-mass slopes over the entire redshift range, reaching values of $\\alpha \\approx -2$ at $zrsim 6$. At the high-mass end, UV-red galaxies dominate at least out to $z\\sim 6$. The implied redshift evolution of the SMF suggests a rapid build-up of massive dust-obscured or quiescent galaxies from $z\\sim 6$ to $z\\sim 4$ as well as an enhanced efficiency of star formation towards earlier times ($zrsim 6$). Finally, we show that the galaxy mass density grows by a factor $\\sim 20\\times$ from $z\\sim 9$ to $z\\sim 4$.

With its rest-frame optical sensitivity, the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has unearthed black holes as massive as 10$^{6.2‑8.1}$ M$\\_{{\\ensuremath{\\odot}}}$ at redshifts of z {\\ensuremath{\\sim}} 8.5 ‑ 10.6. In addition to these unexpectedly high masses, many systems show unexpectedly high ratios of the black hole to stellar mass of M$\\_{BH}$/M$\\_{*}$ {\\ensuremath{\\gtrsim}} 30\\% at these early epochs. This poses a crucial challenge for theoretical models. Methods. We collated data for all of the black holes that were confirmed with the JWST (through spectroscopy, X-rays, or high-ionization emission lines). Using analytic calculations, we explored the combination of astrophysical seeding mechanisms and Eddington accretion rates that can explain the observed objects. We then appeal to cosmological primordial black hole (PBH) seeds and show that these present an alternative path for the seeding of early structures and their baryonic contents. Results. When we assume seeding (via astrophysical means) at a redshift of z$\\_{seed}$ = 25 and continuous accretion, all of the black holes we studied can analytically either be explained through super-Eddington accretion (at an Eddington fraction of f$\\_{Edd}$ {\\ensuremath{\\lesssim}} 2.1) onto low-mass seeds (100 M$\\_{{\\ensuremath{\\odot}}}$) or through Eddington-limited accretion onto high-mass seeds ({}10$^{5}$ M$\\_{{\\ensuremath{\\odot}}}$). The upper limit at which we assume a primordial origin for all of these black holes yields a continuous primordial black hole mass function (between 10$^{‑5.25}$ and 10$^{3.75}$ M$\\_{{\\ensuremath{\\odot}}}$) and a fractional PBH value {\\ensuremath{\\lesssim}}10$^{‑12}$. This agrees well with observational constraints. We then show that PBHs can seed a halo around themselves and assemble their baryonic (gas and stellar contents) starting at the redshift of matter-radiation equality (z {\\ensuremath{\\sim}} 3400). We were able to reproduce the observed stellar and black hole masses for two of the highest-redshift black holes (UHZ1 and GHZ9 at z {\\ensuremath{\\sim}} 10.3) with the same parameters as those that govern star formation, black hole accretion, and their feedbacks. Exploring a wide swathe of model parameter space for GHZ9, we find ratios of black hole to stellar mass between 0.1 ‑ 1.86. This means that in some cases (of high supernova feedback), the black hole grows to be more massive than the stellar mass of its host halo. This is an attractive alternative to seeding these puzzling early systems.}",

We demonstrate the success rate and distribution of the confirmed redshifts, and also highlight the rich information revealed by these ultradeep spectra for a subset of our targets. An updated lens model of A2744 is also presented, including 14 additional spectroscopic redshifts and finding a total cluster mass of M$\\_{SL}$ = (2.1 {\\ensuremath{\\pm}} 0.3) {\\texttimes} {}10$^{15}$ M$\\_{{\\ensuremath{\\odot}}}$.

      "abstract": "{Spectroscopy with the James Webb Space Telescope has opened the possibility of identifying moderate-luminosity active galactic nuclei (AGNs) in the early Universe, at and beyond the epoch of re-ionisation, complementing previous surveys of much more luminous (and much rarer) quasars. We present 12 new AGNs at 4 < z < 7 in the JADES survey (in addition to the previously identified AGN in GN-z11 at z = 10.6) revealed through the detection of a broad-line region (BLR) seen in the Balmer emission lines. The depth of JADES, together with the use of three different spectral resolutions, enables us to probe a lower-mass regime relative to previous studies. In a few cases, we find evidence for two broad components of H{\\ensuremath{\\alpha}}, which suggests that these could be candidate merging black holes (BHs), although a complex BLR geometry cannot be excluded. The inferred BH masses range from 8 {\\texttimes} {}10$^{7}$ M$\\_{{\\ensuremath{\\odot}}}$ down to 4 {\\texttimes} {}10$^{5}$ M$\\_{{\\ensuremath{\\odot}}}$, interestingly probing the regime expected for direct collapse BHs. The inferred AGN bolometric luminosities ({\\ensuremath{\\sim}}{}10$^{44}$ ‑ {}10$^{45}$ erg/s) imply accretion rates that are < 0.5 times the Eddington rate in most cases. However, small BHs, with M$\\_{BH}$ {\\ensuremath{\\sim}} {}10$^{6}$ M$\\_{{\\ensuremath{\\odot}}}$, tend to accrete at Eddington or super-Eddington rates. These BHs at z {\\ensuremath{\\sim}} 4{\\textendash}11 are over-massive relative to their host galaxies' stellar masses when compared to the local M$\\_{BH}$ ‑ M$\\_{star}$ relation, even approaching M$\\_{BH}$ {\\ensuremath{\\sim}} M$\\_{star}$, as was expected from heavy BH seeds and/or super-Eddington accretion scenarios. However, we find that these early BHs tend to be more consistent with the local relation between M$\\_{BH}$ and velocity dispersion, as well as between M$\\_{BH}$ and dynamical mass, suggesting that these are more fundamental and universal relations. On the classical, optical narrow-line excitation-diagnostic diagrams, these AGNs are located in the region that is locally occupied by star- forming galaxies, implying that they would be missed by the standard classification techniques if they did not display broad lines. Their location on the diagram is consistent with what is expected for AGNs hosted in metal-poor galaxies (Z {\\ensuremath{\\sim}} 0.1 ‑ 0.2 Z$\\_{{\\ensuremath{\\odot}}}$). The fraction of broad-line AGNs with L$\\_{AGN}$ > {}10$^{44}$ erg/s among galaxies in the redshift range of 4 < z < 6 is about 10\\%, suggesting that the contribution of AGNs and their hosts to the re-ionisation of the Universe is > 10\\%.}",

Cosmological simulations suggest that rare cold flows converging on primordial haloes in low-shear environments could have created these quasars if they were {}10$^{4}$-{}10$^{5}$ solar masses at birth, but could not resolve their formation$^{5-8}$. Semi-analytical studies of the progenitor halo of a primordial quasar found that it favours the formation of such seeds, but could not verify if one actually appeared$^{9}$. Here we show that a halo at the rare convergence of strong, cold accretion flows creates massive black holes seeds without the need for ultraviolet backgrounds, supersonic streaming motions or even atomic cooling. Cold flows drive violent, supersonic turbulence in the halo, which prevents star formation until it reaches a mass that triggers sudden, catastrophic baryon collapse that forms 31,000 and 40,000 solar- mass stars. This simple, robust process ensures that haloes capable of forming quasars by a redshift of z > 6 produce massive seeds. The first quasars were thus a natural consequence of structure formation in cold dark matter cosmologies, and not exotic, finely tuned environments as previously thought$^{10-14}$.}",

      "abstract": "{The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) observations enable the exploration of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) with broad-line emission in the early universe. Despite their clear radiative and morphological signatures of AGNs in rest-frame optical bands, complementary evidence of AGN activity - such as X-ray emission and UV/optical variability - remains rarely detected. The weakness of X-rays and variability in these broad-line emitters challenges the conventional AGN paradigm, indicating that the accretion processes or environments around the central black holes (BHs) differ from those of low-redshift counterparts. In this work, we study the radiation spectra of super-Eddington accretion disks enveloped by high-density coronae. Radiation-driven outflows from the disk transport mass to the poles, resulting in moderately optically-thick, warm coronae formed through effective inverse Comptonization. This mechanism leads to softer X-ray spectra and larger bolometric correction factors for X-rays compared to typical AGNs, while being consistent with those of JWST AGNs and low-redshift super- Eddington accreting AGNs. In this scenario, UV/optical variability is suppressed due to photon trapping within super- Eddington disks, while X-ray emissions remain weak yet exhibit significant relative variability. These characteristics are particularly evident in high-redshift AGNs powered by lower-mass BHs with $\\lesssim 10^{7-8}\\textasciitilde M\\_\\odot$, which undergo rapid mass accretion following overmassive evolutionary tracks relative to the BH-to-stellar mass correlation in the local universe.}",

      "abstract": "{Here, we present high spectral resolution NIRSpec observations of GN 42437, a low-mass (log(M), compact (pc), extreme starburst galaxy at with 13 emission-line detections. GN 42437 has a low metallicity (5-10 per cent Z) and its rest-frame H equivalent width suggests nearly all of the observed stellar mass formed within the last 3 Myr. GN 42437 has an extraordinary 7 significant [Ne V] 3427 {\\r{A}} detection. The [Ne V] line has a rest-frame equivalent width of {\\r{A}}, [Ne V]/H, [Ne V]/[Ne III] 3870{\\r{A}} , and [Ne V]/He II 4687{\\r{A}} . Ionization from massive stars, shocks, or high-mass X-ray binaries cannot simultaneously produce these [Ne V] and other low-ionization line ratios. Reproducing the complete nebular structure requires both massive stars and accretion on to a black hole. We do not detect broad lines nor do the traditional diagnostics indicate that GN 42437 has an accreting black hole. Thus, the very high- ionization emission lines powerfully diagnose faint narrow-line black holes at high redshift. We approximate the black hole mass in a variety of ways as log(M. This black hole mass is consistent with local relations between the black hole mass and the observed velocity dispersion, but significantly more massive than the stellar mass would predict. Very high-ionization emission lines may reveal samples to probe the formation and growth of the first black holes in the universe.}",

      "abstract": "{Context. One of the surprising early findings with JWST has been the discovery of a strong ``roll-over'' or a softening of the absorption edge of Ly{\\ensuremath{\\alpha}} in a large number of galaxies at z {\\ensuremath{\\gtrsim}} 6, in addition to systematic offsets from photometric redshift estimates and fundamental galaxy scaling relations. This has been interpreted as strong cumulative damped Ly{\\ensuremath{\\alpha}} absorption (DLA) wings from high column densities of neutral atomic hydrogen (H I), signifying major gas accretion events in the formation of these galaxies. Aims. To explore this new phenomenon systematically, we assembled the JWST/NIRSpec PRImordial gas Mass AssembLy (PRIMAL) legacy survey of 584 galaxies at z = 5.0 ‑ 13.4, designed to study the physical properties and gas in and around galaxies during the reionization epoch. Methods. We characterized this benchmark sample in full and spectroscopically derived the galaxy redshifts, metallicities, star formation rates, and ultraviolet (UV) slopes. We defined a new diagnostic, the Ly{\\ensuremath{\\alpha}} damping parameter D$\\_{Ly{\\ensuremath{\\alpha}}}$, to measure and quantify the net effect of Ly{\\ensuremath{\\alpha}} emission strength, the H I fraction in the intergalactic medium, or the local H I column density for each source. The JWST-PRIMAL survey is based on the spectroscopic DAWN JWST Archive (DJA-Spec). We describe DJA-Spec in this paper, detailing the reduction methods, the post- processing steps, and basic analysis tools. All the software, reduced spectra, and spectroscopically derived quantities and catalogs are made publicly available in dedicated repositories. Results. We find that the fraction of galaxies showing strong integrated DLAs with N$\\_{HI}$ > {}10$^{21}$ cm$^{‑2}$ only increases slightly from {\\ensuremath{\\approx}}60\\% at z {\\ensuremath{\\approx}} 6 up to {\\ensuremath{\\approx}}65 ‑ 90\\% at z > 8. Similarly, the prevalence and prominence of Ly{\\ensuremath{\\alpha}} emission is found to increase with decreasing redshift, in qualitative agreement with previous observational results. Strong Ly{\\ensuremath{\\alpha}} emitters (LAEs) are predominantly found to be associated with low- metallicity and UV faint galaxies. By contrast, strong DLAs are observed in galaxies with a variety of intrinsic physical properties, but predominantly at high redshifts and low metallicities. Conclusions. Our results indicate that strong DLAs likely reflect a particular early assembly phase of reionization-era galaxies, at which point they are largely dominated by pristine H I gas accretion. At z = 8 ‑ 10, this gas gradually cools and forms into stars that ionize their local surroundings, forming large ionized bubbles and producing strong observed Ly{\\ensuremath{\\alpha}} emission at z < 8.}",

While Balmer jumps are sometimes observed in low-redshift star-forming galaxies, this galaxy also exhibits a steep turnover in the UV continuum. Such turnovers are typically attributed to absorption by a damped Ly system (DLA); however, the shape of the turnover and the high observed Ly escape fraction () is also consistent with strong nebular two-photon continuum emission. Modelling the UV turnover with a DLA requires extreme column densities ( cm), and simultaneously explaining the high requires a fine-tuned geometry. In contrast, modelling the spectrum as primarily nebular provides a good fit to both the continuum and emission lines, motivating scenarios in which (a) we are observing only nebular emission or (b) the ionizing source is powering extreme nebular emission that outshines the stellar emission. The nebular-only scenario could arise if the ionizing source has 'turned off' more recently than the recombination time-scale (1000 yr), hence we may be catching the object at a very specific time. Alternatively, hot stars with K (e.g. Wolf-Rayet or low-metallicity massive stars) produce enough ionizing photons such that the two-photon emission becomes visible. While several stellar SEDs from the literature fit the observed spectrum well, the hot-star scenario requires that the number of stars relative to stars is significantly higher than predicted by typical stellar initial mass functions (IMFs). The identification of more galaxies with similar spectra may provide evidence for a top-heavy IMF at high redshift.}",

In some cases, these objects might even reach half the stellar mass inferred for the galaxy. It has become a great challenging for theoretical models to understand how these objects formed and grew to these masses. Different ideas range from heavy seed to super-Eddington accretion phases. We take a different approach and try to infer how accurate these MBH mass estimates are and whether we really need to revise our physical models. By considering how the emerging spectrum (both the continuum and the broad lines) of an accreting MBH changes close to and above the Eddington limit, we infer a much larger uncertainty in the MBH mass estimates relative to that of local counterparts. The uncertainty is up to an order of magnitude. We also infer a potential preference for lower masses and higher accretion rates, which i) moves accreting MBHs closer to the local correlations, and ii) might indicate that we witness a widespread phase of very rapid accretion for the first time.}",

Even among the massive galaxies where the previous AGN search is believed to be thorough, 34\\% of the MIRI AGN identifications are new, highlighting the impact of obscuration on previous selections. By combining our results with the efforts at other wavelengths, we build the most complete AGN sample to date and examine the relative performance of different selection techniques. We find the obscured AGN fraction increases from L $\\_{AGN,bol}$ {\\ensuremath{\\sim}} {}10$^{10}$ L $\\_{{\\ensuremath{\\odot}}}$ to {}10$^{11}$ L $\\_{{\\ensuremath{\\odot}}}$ and then drops toward higher luminosity. Additionally, the obscured AGN fraction gradually increases from z {\\ensuremath{\\sim}} 0 to z {\\ensuremath{\\sim}} 4 with most high-z AGNs obscured.

The spectral coverage and the depth of our observations allowed us to select narrow-line AGN based on both rest-frame optical and UV emission lines up to z = 10. Due to the metallicity decrease of galaxies, at z > 3, the standard optical diagnostic diagrams (N2-BPT or S2-VO87) become unable to distinguish many AGN from other sources of photoionisation.

Data from the Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) on board the James Webb Space Telescope provides an excellent opportunity to perform such studies. We take advantage of the MIRI imaging data from the Cosmic Evolution Early Release Science Survey to investigate the AGN population in the distant universe. We estimate the source properties of MIRI-selected objects by utilizing spectral energy distribution (SED) modeling, and classify them into star-forming galaxies (SFs), SF-AGN mixed objects, and AGN.

The median MIRI SED of AGN is similar to the typical SEDs of hot dust-obscured galaxies and Seyfert 2s, for which the mid-IR SEDs are dominated by emission from AGN-heated hot dust. Based on our SED-fit results, we estimate the black hole accretion density (BHAD; i.e., total BH growth rate per comoving volume) as a function of redshift. At z < 3, the resulting BHAD agrees with the X-ray measurements in general. At z > 3, we identify a total of 27 AGN and SF-AGN mixed objects, leading to that our high-z BHAD is substantially higher than the X-ray results (\\raisebox{-0.5ex}\\textasciitilde0.5 dex at z {\\ensuremath{\\approx}} 3-5).

We find that current observational constraints favour models where the growth of BH seeds is Eddington limited and occurs at the Bondi-Hoyle- Lyttleton rate or where super-Eddington accretion occurs via a slim disc during gas-rich galaxy mergers. The main difference between these two model variants lies at the low end of the predicted mass and luminosity functions at 4 {\\ensuremath{\\leq}} z {\\ensuremath{\\leq}} 6, where a clear gap appears in the first model, reflecting the stunted growth of light BH seeds formed as remnants of the first stars. Detecting this signature will be extremely challenging even for the future generation of space observatories, such as JWST, Athena, and Lynx.}",

Despite the widespread presence of AGN signatures in their rest-optical and -ultraviolet spectra, the vast majority of them is X-ray undetected. The stacked X-ray data of the non- detected sources also results in a non-detection. The upper limit on the X-ray emission for many of these AGN is one or even two orders of magnitude lower than expected from a standard AGN Spectral Energy Distribution (SED). X-ray absorption by clouds with large (Compton-thick) column density and low dust content, such as the broad-line region (BLR) clouds, can explain the X-ray weakness. In this scenario, the BLR covering factor should be much larger than in low-z AGN or luminous quasars; this is supported by the larger equivalent width of the broad component of H<inline-formula><tex-math id=``TM0003'' notation=``LaTeX''>$\\alpha$</tex-math></inline-formula> in JWST- selected AGN. We also find that the JWST-discovered AGN lack prominent, fast outflows, suggesting that, in JWST-selected AGN, dense gas lingers in the nuclear region, resulting in large covering factors. We also note that a large fraction of JWST- selected AGN matches the definition of narrow-line Seyfert 1, typically accreting at high rates and characterized by a steep X-ray spectrum - this can further contribute to their observed weakness at high-z. Finally, we discuss that the broad Balmer lines used to identify type 1 AGN cannot be ascribed to very massive stars or supernovae, although we show that some of the faintest broad lines could potentially be associated with superluminous SNe.}",

The radio weakness can also be explained in terms of absorption, as the inferred density of the BLR clouds makes them attenuate the radio emission through free-free absorption. Alternatively, the nuclear magnetic field may be underdeveloped, resulting both in intrinsically weak radio emission and lack of hot corona, hence intrinsic X-ray weakness.

      "abstract": "{The James Webb Space Telescope is now detecting early black holes (BHs) as they transition from ``seeds'' to supermassive BHs. Recently, Bogdan et al. reported the detection of an X-ray luminous supermassive BH, UHZ-1, with a photometric redshift at z > 10. Such an extreme source at this very high redshift provides new insights on seeding and growth models for BHs given the short time available for formation and growth. Harnessing the exquisite sensitivity of JWST/NIRSpec, here we report the spectroscopic confirmation of UHZ-1 at z = 10.073 {\\ensuremath{\\pm}} 0.002. We find that the NIRSpec/Prism spectrum is typical of recently discovered z {\\ensuremath{\\approx}} 10 galaxies, characterized primarily by star formation features. We see no clear evidence of the powerful X-ray source in the rest-frame UV/optical spectrum, which may suggest heavy obscuration of the central BH, in line with the Compton-thick column density measured in the X-rays. We perform a stellar population fit simultaneously to the new NIRSpec spectroscopy and previously available photometry. The fit yields a stellar-mass estimate for the host galaxy that is significantly better constrained than prior photometric estimates ( ${M}\\_{\\star }\\sim {1.4}\\_{-0.4}^{+0.3}\\times {10}^{8}$ M $\\_{{\\ensuremath{\\odot}}}$).

However, JWST has also revealed that some of the classical diagnostics, such as the Baldwin, Phillips \\& Terlevich (BPT) diagrams and X-ray emission, often fail to identify active galactic nuclei (AGN) at high redshift and low metallicity. Here we present three new rest-frame optical diagnostic diagrams to identify narrow-line Type II AGN, leveraging the [OIII]{\\ensuremath{\\lambda}}4363 auroral line, which has been detected in several JWST spectra. Specifically, we show that high values of the [OIII]{\\ensuremath{\\lambda}} 4363 / H{\\ensuremath{\\gamma}} ratio provide a sufficient (but not necessary) condition to identify the presence of an AGN, based on empirical calibrations (using local and high-redshift sources) and on a broad range of photoionization models. These diagnostics are able to separate much of the AGN population from star-forming galaxies (SFGs): the average energy of an AGN's ionizing photons is higher than that of young stars in SFGs, and hence AGN can more efficiently heat the gas, thus boosting the [OIII]{\\ensuremath{\\lambda}}4363 line. We also found independent indications of AGN activity in some high-redshift sources (z > 4) that were not previously identified as AGN with the traditional diagnostics diagrams, but that are placed in the AGN region of the diagnostic presented in this work. We note, conversely, that low values of [OIII]{\\ensuremath{\\lambda}} 4363 / H{\\ensuremath{\\gamma}} can be associated either with SFGs or AGN excitation. We note that the fact that strong auroral lines are often associated with AGN does not imply that they cannot be used for direct metallicity measurements (provided that proper ionization corrections are applied), but it does affect the calibration of strong line metallicity diagnostics.}",

In preparation for deep JWST imaging surveys, it is crucial to understand the color selection of high-redshift accreting seed BHs. We model the spectral energy distribution of super- Eddington accreting BHs with millions of solar masses in metal- poor galaxies at z {\\ensuremath{\\gtrsim}} 8, applying postprocess line transfer calculations to radiation hydrodynamical simulation results. Exposures of 10 ks with the NIRCam and MIRI broadband filters are sufficient to detect the radiation flux from the seed BHs with bolometric luminosities of L $\\_{bol}$ ≃ {}10$^{45}$ erg s$^{-1}$. While the continuum colors are similar to those of typical low-z quasars, strong H{\\ensuremath{\\alpha}} line emission with a rest-frame equivalent width EW$\\_{rest}$ ≃ 1300 {\\r{A}} is so prominent that the line flux affects the broadband colors significantly. The unique colors, for instance, F356W - F560W {\\ensuremath{\\gtrsim}} 1 at 7 < z < 8 and F444W - F770W {\\ensuremath{\\gtrsim}} 1 at 9 < z < 12, provide robust criteria for photometric selection of rapidly growing seed BHs. Moreover, NIRSpec observations of low-ionization emission lines can test whether the BH is fed via a dense accretion disk at super- Eddington rates.}",

We discuss the potential effects of dust extinction on our measured fluxes and the impact of selection effects on high- redshift quasar samples. We conclude that the masses of the SMBHs relative to the host galaxy stellar masses have a much larger scatter than locally, large enough that these selection effects cannot be responsible.

We construct the rest-frame ultraviolet luminosity functions at z {\\ensuremath{\\sim}} 9, 11, and 14 and show that the space density of bright (M $\\_{UV}$ = ‑20) galaxies changes only modestly from z {\\ensuremath{\\sim}} 14 to z {\\ensuremath{\\sim}} 9, compared to a steeper increase from z {\\ensuremath{\\sim}} 8 to z {\\ensuremath{\\sim}} 4. While our candidates are photometrically selected, spectroscopic follow-up has now confirmed 13 of them, with only one significant interloper, implying that the fidelity of this sample is high. Successfully explaining the evidence for a flatter evolution in the number densities of UV-bright z > 10 galaxies may thus require changes to the dominant physical processes regulating star formation. While our results indicate that significant variations of dust attenuation with redshift are unlikely to be the dominant factor at these high redshifts, they are consistent with predictions from models that naturally have enhanced star formation efficiency and/or stochasticity. An evolving stellar initial mass function could also bring model predictions into better agreement with our results. Deep spectroscopic follow-up of a large sample of early galaxies can distinguish between these competing scenarios.}",

Most striking were detections of nebular C IV emission in what appeared to be typical low-mass galaxies, requiring an ample supply of 48 eV photons to triply ionize carbon. We have obtained deep JWST/NIRSpec R = 1000 spectroscopy of the two z > 6 C IV-emitting galaxies known prior to JWST. Here, we present a rest-UV to optical spectrum of one of these two systems, the multiply-imaged z = 6.1 lensed galaxy RXCJ2248-ID. NIRCam imaging reveals two compact (<22 pc) clumps separated by 220 pc, with one comprising a dense concentration of massive stars (>10 400 M$\\_{{\\ensuremath{\\odot}} }$yr$^{-1}$ kpc$^{-2}$) formed in a recent burst. We stack spectra of 3 images of the galaxy (J = 24.8-25.9), yielding a very deep spectrum providing a high-S/N template of strong emission line sources at z > 6. The spectrum reveals narrow high-ionization lines (He II, C IV, N IV]) with line ratios consistent with powering by massive stars. The rest- optical spectrum is dominated by very strong emission lines ([O III] EW = 2800 {\\r{A}}), albeit with weak emission from low- ionization transitions ([O III]/[O II] = 184). The electron density is found to be very high (6.4-31.0 {\\texttimes} 10$^{4 }$cm$^{-3}$) based on three UV transitions. The ionized gas is metal poor ($12+\\log (\\rm O/H)=7.43^{+0.17}\\_{-0.09}$), yet highly enriched in nitrogen ($\\log (\\rm N/O)=-0.39^{+0.11}\\_{-0.10}$). The spectrum appears broadly similar to that of GNz11 at z = 10.6, without showing the same AGN signatures. We suggest that the hard radiation field and rapid nitrogen enrichment may be a short-lived phase that many z > 6 galaxies go through as they undergo strong bursts of star formation. We comment on the potential link of such spectra to globular cluster formation.}",

Most of these AGN are hosted in low-mass ( M) galaxies and are overmassive relative to the local relation, while remaining consistent with the local ─ relation. The wide redshift range provided by our sample allows us to trace the emergence of local ─ scaling relation across cosmic time. Additionally, we explore the capability of narrow-line diagnostics in identifying Type 2 AGN and find that a significant fraction of our AGN would be missed by them due to low metallicity or lack of high-energy ionizing photons. We explore the UV luminosity function of AGN and their hosts and find that it is subject to significant cosmic variance and is also dependent on the AGN bolometric luminosity.

Simulations indicate an evolutionary sequence of dust-reddened quasars emerging from heavily dust- obscured starbursts that then transition to unobscured luminous quasars by expelling gas and dust$^{5}$. Although the last phase has been identified out to a redshift of 7.6 (ref. $^{6}$), a transitioning quasar has not been found at similar redshifts owing to their faintness at optical and near-infrared wavelengths. Here we report observations of an ultraviolet compact object, GNz7q, associated with a dust-enshrouded starburst at a redshift of 7.1899 {\\ensuremath{\\pm}} 0.0005. The host galaxy is more luminous in dust emission than any other known object at this epoch, forming 1,600 solar masses of stars per year within a central radius of 480 parsec. A red point source in the far-ultraviolet is identified in deep, high- resolution imaging and slitless spectroscopy. GNz7q is extremely faint in X-rays, which indicates the emergence of a uniquely ultraviolet compact star-forming region or a Compton-thick super-Eddington black-hole accretion disk at the dusty starburst core.

To better understand the physical conditions in the broad-line regions (BLRs) of these early AGNs, we used the optical Fe II (4434{\\textendash}4684 {\\r{A}}) and the broad H{\\ensuremath{\\beta}}emission, and the ratio between their equivalent widths R$\\_{Fe}$, as a probe on a purposefully assembled sample. Specifically, we gathered a sample of 31 high redshift (⟨z⟩ = 6.5) AGNs, observed by JWST, with broad H{\\ensuremath{\\beta}}detection both in the high and low luminosity regimes (respectively 14 faint AGNs and 17 quasars), to investigate their optical Fe II emission properties. In addition, we carefully selected control samples at lower z. We found that the population of faint AGNs (log(L$\\_{H{\\ensuremath{\\beta}},br}$/(erg s$^{‑1}$)) {\\ensuremath{\\lesssim}} 44) exhibits a significantly lower Fe II emission than their local counterparts having a mean (median) R$\\_{Fe}$ < 0.24 (0.12) versus R$\\_{Fe}$ ≃ 0.90 (0.79) in the control sample. At the same time, the quasars at the epoch of reionisation observed by JWST present a Fe II emission profile that closely resembles that observed at z < 3. We argue that the weakness of the Fe II bump in the faint JWST AGNs might be due to the reduced metallicity of their broad line region ({\\ensuremath{\\lesssim}}0.5 Z$\\_{{\\ensuremath{\\odot}}}$), while luminous quasars have already reached chemical maturity ({\\ensuremath{\\sim}}Z$\\_{{\\ensuremath{\\odot}}}$ or higher). Lastly, we highlight an intriguing similarity between the spectral properties of the high redshift population of faint AGNs with those harboured in local metal poor dwarf galaxies.}",

      "abstract": "{JWST has detected many overmassive galactic systems at z > 4, where the mass of the black hole, M $\\_{{\\textbullet}}$, is 10{\\textendash}100 times larger than expected from local relations, given the host's stellar mass, M $\\_{{\\ensuremath{\\star}}}$. This paper presents a model to describe these overmassive systems in the high-z Universe. We suggest that the black hole mass is the main driver of high-z star formation quenching. Supermassive black holes globally impact their high-z galaxies because their hosts are physically small, and the black holes have duty cycles close to unity at z > 4. In this regime, we assume that black hole mass growth is regulated by the quasar's output, while stellar mass growth is quenched by it and uncorrelated to the global properties of the host halo. We find that the ratio M $\\_{{\\textbullet}}$/M $\\_{{\\ensuremath{\\star}}}$ controls the average star formation efficiency: if M $\\_{{\\textbullet}}$/M $\\_{{\\ensuremath{\\star}}}$ > 8 {\\texttimes} {}10$^{18}$(n{\\ensuremath{\\Lambda}}/ f $\\_{Edd}$)[({\\ensuremath{\\Omega}}$\\_{ b }$ M $\\_{ h }$)/({\\ensuremath{\\Omega}}$\\_{ m }$ M $\\_{{\\ensuremath{\\star}}}$) ‑ 1], then the galaxy is unable to form stars efficiently. Once this ratio exceeds the threshold, a runaway process brings the originally overmassive system toward the local M $\\_{{\\textbullet}}${\\textendash}M $\\_{{\\ensuremath{\\star}}}$ relation. Furthermore, the M $\\_{{\\textbullet}}${\\textendash}M $\\_{{\\ensuremath{\\star}}}$ relation evolves with redshift as {\\ensuremath{\\propto}}(1 + z)$^{5/2}$. At z {\\ensuremath{\\sim}} 5, we find an overmassive factor of {\\ensuremath{\\sim}}55, in excellent agreement with current JWST data and the high-z relation inferred from those. Extending the black hole horizon farther in redshift and lower in mass will test this model and improve our understanding of the early coevolution of black holes and galaxies.}",

      "abstract": "{We study a new population of extremely red objects (EROs) recently discovered by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) based on their NIRCam colors F277W ‑ F444W > 1.5 mag. We find 37 EROs in the Cosmic Evolution Early Release Science Survey (CEERS) field with F444W < 28 mag and photometric redshifts between 5 < z < 7, with median $z={6.9}\\_{-1.6}^{+1.0}$ . Surprisingly, despite their red long-wavelength colors, these EROs have blue short- wavelength colors (F150W ‑ F200W {\\ensuremath{\\sim}} 0 mag) indicative of bimodal spectral energy distributions (SEDs) with a red, steep slope in the rest-frame optical, and a blue, flat slope in the rest-frame UV. Moreover, all these EROs are unresolved, point-like sources in all NIRCam bands. We analyze the SEDs of eight of them with MIRI and NIRSpec observations using stellar population models and active galactic nucleus (AGN) templates. We find that dusty galaxies or obscured AGNs provide similarly good SED fits but different stellar properties: massive and dusty, $\\mathrm{log}{M}\\_{\\star }/{M}\\_{\\odot }$ {\\ensuremath{\\sim}} 10 and A $\\_{ V }$ {\\ensuremath{\\gtrsim}} 3 mag, or low mass and obscured, $\\mathrm{log}{M}\\_{\\star }/{M}\\_{\\odot }$ {\\ensuremath{\\sim}} 7.5 and A $\\_{ V }$ {\\ensuremath{\\sim}} 0 mag, hosting an obscured quasi-stellar object (QSO).

If any EROs are confirmed to have $\\mathrm{log}{M}\\_{\\star }/{M}\\_{\\odot }$ {\\ensuremath{\\gtrsim}} 10.5, it would increase the pre-JWST number density at z > 7 by up to a factor {\\ensuremath{\\sim}}60.

Additional photometry at mid-infrared wavelengths will reveal the true nature of the red continuum emission in these EROs and will place this puzzling population in the right context of galaxy evolution.}",

Current observations, able to trace both gas and stellar properties, reveal a population of MBHs that is significantly more massive than expected from the local MBH- stellar mass relation. The population lies on, but mostly above, the relation observed in the nearby Universe. This suggests that these objects grew very rapidly. To explain their presence when the Universe was less than 1 Gyr old and to assess the physical conditions for their rapid growth, we explored whether episodes of accretion above the Eddington limit can occur across cosmic epochs. By employing state-of-the-art high-resolution cosmological zoom-in simulations of a z {\\ensuremath{\\sim}} 7 quasar, where different accretion regimes are included consistently, together with their associated radiative and kinetic feedback, we show that super-Eddington phases can be sustained for relatively long timescales (tens of millions of years). This allows the MBH to rapidly grow by up to three orders of magnitude, depending on the strength of the kinetic feedback. We also show by means of a semianalytic calculation that the MBH spin remains moderate and does not take on extremely high values during the super-Eddington phases. This results in a lower feedback efficiency, which may allow the rapid growth required to explain over-massive high-redshift MBHs.}",

      "abstract": "{The recent Chandra-JWST discovery of a quasar in the z {\\ensuremath{\\approx}} 10.1 galaxy UHZ1 reveals that accreting supermassive black holes were already in place 470 million years after the Big Bang. The Chandra X-ray source detected in UHZ1 is a Compton-thick quasar with a bolometric luminosity of L $\\_{bol}$ \\raisebox{-0.5ex}\\textasciitilde 5 {\\texttimes} {}10$^{45}$ erg s$^{-1}$, which corresponds to an estimated black hole (BH) mass of \\raisebox{-0.5ex}\\textasciitilde4 {\\texttimes} {}10$^{7}$ M $\\_{{\\ensuremath{\\odot}}}$, assuming accretion at the Eddington rate. JWST NIRCAM and NIRSpec data yield a stellar mass estimate for UHZ1 comparable to its BH mass. These characteristics are in excellent agreement with prior theoretical predictions for a unique class of transient, high-redshift objects, overmassive black hole galaxies (OBGs) by Natarajan et al., that harbor a heavy initial black hole seed that likely formed from the direct collapse of the gas. Given the excellent agreement between the observed multiwavelength properties of UHZ1 and theoretical model template predictions, we suggest that UHZ1 is the first detected OBG candidate. Our assertion rests on multiple lines of concordant evidence between model predictions and the following observed properties of UHZ1: its X-ray detection and the estimated ratio of the X-ray flux to the IR flux, which is consistent with theoretical expectations for a heavy initial BH seed; its high measured redshift of z {\\ensuremath{\\approx}} 10.1, as predicted for the transient OBG stage (9 < z < 12); the amplitude and shape of the detected JWST spectral energy distribution (SED) between 1 and 5 {\\ensuremath{\\mu}}m, which is in very good agreement with simulated template SEDs for OBGs; and the extended JWST morphology of UHZ1, which is suggestive of a recent merge and is also expected for the formation of transient OBGs. As the first OBG candidate, UHZ1 provides compelling evidence for the formation of heavy initial seeds from direct collapse in the early Universe.}",

Together with existing Hubble Space Telescope (HST) imaging, this publicly available data set opens a fundamentally new discovery space to understand the remaining mysteries of the formation and evolution of galaxies across cosmic time. In this work, we detect and measure some 60,000 objects across the 49 arcmin$^{2}$ JWST footprint down to a 5{\\ensuremath{\\sigma}} limiting magnitude of \\raisebox{-0.5ex}\\textasciitilde30 mag in 0.″32 apertures. Photometry is performed using circular apertures on images matched to the point-spread function (PSF) of the reddest NIRCam broad band, F444W, and cleaned of bright cluster galaxies and the related intracluster light. To give an impression of the photometric performance, we measure photometric redshifts and achieve a {\\ensuremath{\\sigma}} $\\_{NMAD}$ {\\ensuremath{\\approx}} 0.03 based on known, but relatively small, spectroscopic samples. With this paper, we publicly release our HST and JWST PSF-matched photometric catalog with optimally assigned aperture sizes for easy use, along with single aperture catalogs, photometric redshifts, rest-frame colors, and individual magnification estimates. These catalogs will set the stage for efficient and deep spectroscopic follow up of some of the first JWST-selected samples in summer of 2023.}",

The novel observing strategy of RUBIES offers a well-quantified selection function. The survey has been optimised to reach high (>70\\%) spectroscopic completeness for bright and red (F150W‑F444W>2) sources that are very rare. To place these rare sources in context, we simultaneously observed a reference sample of the 2<z<7 galaxy population, sampling sources at a rate that is inversely proportional to their number density in the 3D parameter space of F444W magnitude, F150W‑F444W colour, and photometric redshift. In total, RUBIES observed {\\ensuremath{\\sim}}3000 targets across 1<z$\\_{phot}$<10 with both the PRISM and G395M dispersers and {\\ensuremath{\\sim}}1500 targets at z$\\_{phot}$>3 using only the G395M disperser. The RUBIES data reveal a highly diverse population of red sources that span a broad redshift range (z$\\_{spec}${\\ensuremath{\\sim}}1‑9), with photometric redshift scatter and an outlier fraction that are three times higher than for similarly bright sources that are less red. This diversity is not apparent from the photometric spectral energy distributions (SEDs). Only spectroscopy reveals that the SEDs encompass a mixture of galaxies with dust-obscured star formation, extreme line emission, a lack of star formation indicating early quenching, and luminous active galactic nuclei. As a first demonstration of our broader selection function we compared the stellar masses and rest-frame U‑V colours of the red sources and our reference sample. We find that the red sources are typically more massive (M$\\_{*}${\\ensuremath{\\sim}}10$^{10‑11.5}$ M$\\_{{\\ensuremath{\\odot}}}$) across all redshifts. However, we also find that the most massive systems span a wide range in U‑V colour.

In this work, we spectroscopically select narrow-line AGNs (NLAGNs) among the {\\ensuremath{\\sim}}300 publicly available medium-resolution spectra of the Cosmic Evolution Early Release Science Survey (CEERS). Using both traditional and newly identified emission line NLAGN diagnostics diagrams, we identified 52 NLAGNs at 2 {\\ensuremath{\\lesssim}} z {\\ensuremath{\\lesssim}} 9, on which we performed a detailed multiwavelength analysis. We also identified four new z {\\ensuremath{\\lesssim}} 2 broad-line AGNs (BLAGNs), in addition to the eight previously reported z > 4.5 BLAGNs. We found that the traditional BPT diagnostic diagrams are not suited to identifying high-z AGNs, while most of the high-z NLAGN were selected using the recently proposed AGN diagnostic diagrams based on the [O III] {\\ensuremath{\\lambda}}4363 auroral line or high-ionization emission lines. We compared the emission line velocity dispersion and the obscuration levels of the sample of NLAGNs with those of the parent sample without finding significant differences between the two distributions, suggesting a population of AGNs heavily buried and not significantly impacting the host galaxies' physical properties, as was further confirmed by spectral energy distribution fitting. The bolometric luminosities of the high-z NLAGNs selected in this work are {\\ensuremath{\\sim}}1.5 dex below the ones sampled by surveys before JWST, potentially explaining the weak impact of these AGNs. Finally, we investigated the X-ray properties of the selected NLAGNs and of the sample of high-z BLAGNs. We found that all but four NLAGNs are undetected in the deep X-ray image of the field, as well as all the high-z BLAGNs. We did not obtain a detection even by stacking the undetected sources, resulting in an X-ray weakness of {\\ensuremath{\\sim}}1 ‑ 2 dex from what was expected based on their bolometric luminosities. To discriminate between a heavily obscured AGN scenario or an intrinsic X-ray weakness of these sources, we performed a radio (1.4GHz) stacking analysis, which did not reveal any detection and left open the questions about the origin of the X-ray weakness.}",

Additionally, the resulting ERDF shows a negative dependence on BH mass, suggesting more massive SMBHs tend to accrete at lower-Eddington ratios at z = 4. With the derived intrinsic broad-line AGN BHMF, we also evaluate the active fraction of broad-line AGNs among the entire SMBH population at z = 4. The resulting active fraction may suggest a positive dependence on BH mass. Finally, we examine the time evolution of broad-line AGN BHMF between z = 4 and 6 through solving the continuity equation.

In the era of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), Euclid, and Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope, their unprecedented detection sensitivity and wide survey area can unveil the low-luminosity quasar and low-mass BH population, and provide new insights into quasar host galaxies. We present a theoretical model describing BH growth from initial seeding at z {\\ensuremath{\\gtrsim}} 20 to {\\ensuremath{\\sim}} 4, incorporating the duration of accretion episodes, the distribution of Eddington ratios, and the mass dependency of BH accretion rates. By constraining the model parameters with the observed QLFs at 4 {\\ensuremath{\\leq}} z {\\ensuremath{\\leq}} 6 across a wide UV luminosity range, we find that the high- redshift BH population grows rapidly at z {\\ensuremath{\\gtrsim}} 6, and decelerates the pace in subsequent epochs. Toward lower redshifts (z < 6), mass-dependent accretion inhibits the growth of high-mass BHs with M $\\_{{\\textbullet}}$ > {}10$^{8}$ M $\\_{{\\ensuremath{\\odot}}}$, leading to mass saturation at M $\\_{{\\textbullet}}$ {\\ensuremath{\\gtrsim}} {}10$^{10}$ M $\\_{{\\ensuremath{\\odot}}}$.

Our model accounts for the presence of both bright and faint quasars at z > 4, including those discovered by JWST.

      "abstract": "{While supermassive black holes (SMBHs) are widely observed in the nearby and distant Universe, their origin remains debated with two viable formation scenarios with light and heavy seeds. In the light seeding model, the seed of the first SMBHs form from the collapse of massive stars with masses of 10{\\textendash}100 M $\\_{{\\ensuremath{\\odot}}}$, while the heavy seeding model posits the formation of 10$^{4{\\textendash}5}$ M $\\_{{\\ensuremath{\\odot}}}$ seeds from direct collapse. The detection of SMBHs at redshifts z {\\ensuremath{\\gtrsim}} 10, edging closer to their formation epoch, provides critical observational discrimination between these scenarios. Here, we focus on the JWST-detected galaxy, GHZ 9, at z {\\ensuremath{\\approx}} 10 that is lensed by the foreground cluster, A2744. Based on 2.1 Ms deep Chandra observations, we detect a candidate X-ray active galactic nucleus (AGN), which is spatially coincident with the high-redshift galaxy, GHZ 9. The SMBH candidate is inferred to have a bolometric luminosity of $({1.0}\\_{-0.4}^{+0.5})\\times {10}^{46}\\ \\mathrm{erg}\\,{{\\rm{s}}}^{-1}$ , which corresponds to a black hole (BH) mass of $({8.0}\\_{-3.2}^{+3.7})\\times {10}^{7}\\ {M}\\_{\\odot }$ assuming Eddington-limited accretion. This extreme mass at such an early cosmic epoch suggests the heavy seed origin for this BH candidate. Based on the Chandra and JWST discoveries of extremely high-redshift quasars, we have constructed the first simple AGN luminosity function extending to z {\\ensuremath{\\approx}} 10. Comparison of this luminosity function with theoretical models indicates an overabundant z {\\ensuremath{\\approx}} 10 SMBH population, consistent with a higher-than-expected seed formation efficiency.}",

      "abstract": "{Within the established framework of structure formation, galaxies start as systems of low stellar mass and gradually grow into far more massive galaxies. The existence of massive galaxies in the first billion years of the Universe, as suggested by recent observations, seems to challenge this model, as such galaxies would require highly efficient conversion of baryons into stars. An even greater challenge in this epoch is the existence of massive galaxies that have already ceased forming stars. However, robust detections of early massive quiescent galaxies have been challenging due to the coarse wavelength sampling of photometric surveys. Here we report the spectroscopic confirmation with the James Webb Space Telescope of the quiescent galaxy RUBIES-EGS-QG-1 at redshift z = 4.90, 1.2 billion years after the Big Bang. Deep stellar absorption features in the spectrum reveal that the stellar mass of the galaxy of {}10$^{11}$ M$\\_{{\\ensuremath{\\odot}}}$ formed in a short 200 Myr burst of star formation, after which star formation activity dropped rapidly and persistently. According to current galaxy formation models, systems with such rapid stellar mass growth and early quenching are too rare to plausibly occur in the small area probed spectroscopically with JWST. Instead, the discovery of RUBIES-EGS-QG-1 implies that early massive quiescent galaxies can be quenched earlier or exhaust gas available for star formation more efficiently than assumed at present.}",

      "abstract": "{We provide an overview of the capabilities and performance of the Near- Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSpec) on the James Webb Space Telescope when used in its multi-object spectroscopy (MOS) mode employing a novel Micro Shutter Array (MSA) slit device. The MSA consists of four separate 98″ {\\texttimes} 91″ quadrants each containing 365 {\\texttimes} 171 individually addressable shutters whose open areas on the sky measure 0.20″ {\\texttimes} 0.46″ on a 0.27″ {\\texttimes} 0.53″ pitch. This is the first time that a configurable multi-object spectrograph has been available on a space mission. The levels of multiplexing achievable with NIRSpec MOS mode are quantified and we show that NIRSpec will be able to observe typically fifty to two hundred objects simultaneously with the pattern of close to a quarter of a million shutters provided by the MSA. This pattern is fixed and regular, and we identify the specific constraints that it yields for NIRSpec observation planning. In particular, the roll angle at which a given NIRSpec MSA observation will be executed will, in most cases, not be known before the observation is actually scheduled. As a consequence, NIRSpec users planning MOS mode observations cannot at the proposal stage know precisely which subset of their intended targets will be observable, and will therefore need to intentionally oversize their submitted target catalogues accordingly. We also present the data processing and calibration steps planned for the NIRSpec MOS data. The significant variation in size of the mostly diffraction-limited instrument point spread function over the large wavelength range of 0.6-5.3 {\\textmu}m covered by the instrument, combined with the fact that most targets observed with the MSA cannot be expected to be perfectly centred within their respective slits, makes the spectrophotometric and wavelength calibration of the obtained spectra particularly complex. This is reflected by the inclusion of specific steps such as the wavelength zero-point correction nd the relative path loss correction in the NIRSpec data processing and calibration flow. The processing of spectra of morphologically extended targets will require additional attention and development. These challenges notwithstanding, the sensitivity and multiplexing capabilities anticipated of NIRSpec in MOS mode are unprecedented, and should enable significant progress to be made in addressing a wide range of outstanding astrophysical problems.}",

Because there are many discrepancies between the flux measurements reported by the early ERO studies, we first establish our NIRSpec data reduction procedure for reliable emission-line flux measurements and errors, successfully explaining Balmer decrements with no statistical tensions thorough comparisons with the early ERO studies. Applying the reduction procedure to the 135 galaxies, we obtain emission-line fluxes for physical property measurements. We confirm that 10 out of the 135 galaxies with [O III] {\\ensuremath{\\lambda}}4363 lines have electron temperatures of ≃(1.1-2.3) {\\texttimes} {}10$^{4}$ K, similar to lower-z star- forming galaxies, which can be explained by heating by young massive stars. We derive the metallicities of the 10 galaxies by a direct method and the rest of the galaxies with strong lines using the metallicity calibrations of Nakajima et al. applicable for these low-mass metal-poor galaxies, anchoring the metallicities with the direct-method measurements. We thus obtain the MZ relation and star formation rate (SFR)-MZ relation over z = 4-10.

We use bright unsaturated stars to construct models of the point-spread functions (PSFs) and estimate the errors of these PSFs.

We make use of the first epoch of CEERS NIRCam imaging, spanning 35.5 arcmin$^{2}$, to search for candidate galaxies at z > 9. Following a detailed data reduction process implementing several custom steps to produce high-quality reduced images, we perform multiband photometry across seven NIRCam broad- and medium-band (and six Hubble broadband) filters focusing on robust colors and accurate total fluxes. We measure photometric redshifts and devise a robust set of selection criteria to identify a sample of 26 galaxy candidates at z \\raisebox{-0.5ex}\\textasciitilde 9-16. These objects are compact with a median half-light radius of \\raisebox{-0.5ex}\\textasciitilde0.5 kpc.

We also find that the abundance (surface density [arcmin$^{-2}$]) of our candidates exceeds nearly all theoretical predictions. We explore potential implications, including that at z > 10, star formation may be dominated by top-heavy initial mass functions, which would result in an increased ratio of UV light per unit halo mass, though a complete lack of dust attenuation and/or changing star formation physics may also play a role. While spectroscopic confirmation of these sources is urgently required, our results suggest that the deeper views to come with JWST should yield prolific samples of ultrahigh-redshift galaxies with which to further explore these conclusions.}",

This field falls within the GOODS-S region about 8' southwest of the Hubble Ultra Deep Field (HUDF), where it was formed initially in Cycle 1 as a parallel field of HUDF spectroscopic observations within the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES). This imaging was greatly extended in Cycle 2 program 3215, which observed the JOF for 5 days in six medium-band filters, seeking robust candidates for z > 15 galaxies. This program also includes ultradeep parallel NIRSpec spectroscopy (up to 91 hr on source, summing over the dispersion modes) on the HUDF. Cycle 3 observations from program 4540 added 20 hr of NIRCam slitless spectroscopy and F070W imaging to the JOF. With these three campaigns, the JOF was observed for 380 open-shutter hours with NIRCam using 15 imaging filters and two grism bandpasses. Further, parts of the JOF have deep 43 hr MIRI observations in F770W. Taken together, the JOF is one of the most compelling deep fields available with JWST and a powerful window into the early Universe. This paper presents the second data release from JADES, featuring the imaging and catalogs from the year 1 JOF observations.}",

Observations with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) have uncovered a surprisingly high abundance of candidates for early star-forming galaxies, with distances (redshifts, z), estimated from multiband photometry, as large as z {\\ensuremath{\\approx}} 16, far beyond pre-JWST limits$^{4-9}$. Although such photometric redshifts are generally robust, they can suffer from degeneracies and occasionally catastrophic errors. Spectroscopic measurements are required to validate these sources and to reliably quantify physical properties that can constrain galaxy formation models and cosmology$^{10}$. Here we present JWST spectroscopy that confirms redshifts for two very luminous galaxies with z > 11, and also demonstrates that another candidate with suggested z {\\ensuremath{\\approx}} 16 instead has z = 4.9, with an unusual combination of nebular line emission and dust reddening that mimics the colours expected for much more distant objects. These results reinforce evidence for the early, rapid formation of remarkably luminous galaxies while also highlighting the necessity of spectroscopic verification. The large abundance of bright, early galaxies may indicate shortcomings in current galaxy formation models or deviations from physical properties (such as the stellar initial mass function) that are generally believed to hold at later times.}",

      "abstract": "{The selection of high-redshift galaxies often involves spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting to photometric data, an expectation for contamination levels, and measurement of sample completeness-all vetted through comparison to spectroscopic redshift measurements of a sub-sample. The first JWST data are now being taken over several extragalactic fields to different depths and across various areas, which will be ideal for the discovery and classification of galaxies out to distances previously uncharted. As spectroscopic redshift measurements for sources in this epoch will not be initially available to compare with the first photometric measurements of z > 8 galaxies, robust photometric redshifts are of the utmost importance. Galaxies at z > 8 are expected to have bluer rest-frame ultraviolet (UV) colors than typically used model SED templates, which could lead to catastrophic photometric redshift failures. We use a combination of BPASS and CLOUDY models to create a supporting set of templates that match the predicted rest-UV colors of z > 8 simulated galaxies. We test these new templates by fitting simulated galaxies in a mock catalog, Yung et al., which mimic expected field depths and areas of the JWST Cosmic Evolution Early Release Science Survey (m $\\_{5{\\ensuremath{\\sigma}} }$ \\raisebox{-0.5ex}\\textasciitilde 28.6 over \\raisebox{-0.5ex}\\textasciitilde100 arcmin$^{2}$).

These trajectories suggest that radiative-mode feedback cannot quench the growth of BHs and their host galaxies for AGNs that lie below the relation, while kinetic-mode feedback barely suppresses long- term star formation for AGNs situated above the relation.

The advent of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has exacerbated this issue by confirming the existence of galaxies in substantial numbers as early as the first few hundred million years$^{6-8}$. Perhaps even more surprisingly, in some galaxies, this initial highly efficient star formation rapidly shuts down, or quenches, giving rise to massive quiescent galaxies as little as 1.5 billion years after the Big Bang$^{9,10}$. However, due to their faintness and red colour, it has proven extremely challenging to learn about these extreme quiescent galaxies, or to confirm whether any existed at earlier times. Here we report the spectroscopic confirmation of a massive quiescent galaxy, GS-9209, at redshift, z = 4.658, just 1.25 billion years after the Big Bang, using the JWST Near-Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSpec). From these data we infer a stellar mass of M$\\_{*}$ = 3.8 {\\ensuremath{\\pm}} 0.2 {\\texttimes} {}10$^{10}$ M$\\_{{\\ensuremath{\\odot}}}$, which formed over a roughly 200 Myr period before this galaxy quenched its star-formation activity at z =6.5$\\_{-0.5}$$^{+0.2}$ , when the Universe was approximately 800 Myr old.

Here, we report the remarkable similarity in SEDs between JWST-EROs and blue-excess dust-obscured galaxies (BluDOGs) identified at 2 < z < 3.

The steep UV slope ( {\\ensuremath{\\beta}}={\\ensuremath{-}}2.5{\\ensuremath{-}}0.2+0.2) implies negligible dust attenuation and a young stellar population. The absence of a strong damping wing provides tentative evidence that the immediate surroundings of MoM-z14 may be partially ionized at a redshift where virtually every reionization model predicts a ≍100\\% neutral fraction. The nitrogen emission and highly super-solar [N/C] >1 hint at an abundance pattern similar to local globular clusters that may have once hosted luminous supermassive stars. Since this abundance pattern is also common among the most ancient stars born in the Milky Way, we may be directly witnessing the formation of such stars in dense clusters, connecting galaxy evolution across the entire sweep of cosmic time.}",

      "abstract": "{Context. We present the third data release of the European Space Agency's Gaia mission, Gaia DR3. This release includes a large variety of new data products, notably a much expanded radial velocity survey and a very extensive astrophysical characterisation of Gaia sources. \\textbackslash Aims: We outline the content and the properties of Gaia DR3, providing an overview of the main improvements in the data processing in comparison with previous data releases (where applicable) and a brief discussion of the limitations of the data in this release. \\textbackslash Methods: The Gaia DR3 catalogue is the outcome of the processing of raw data collected with the Gaia instruments during the first 34 months of the mission by the Gaia Data Processing and Analysis Consortium. \\textbackslash Results: The Gaia DR3 catalogue contains the same source list, celestial positions, proper motions, parallaxes, and broad band photometry in the G, G$\\_{BP}$, and G$\\_{RP}$ pass-bands already present in the Early Third Data Release, Gaia EDR3. Gaia DR3 introduces an impressive wealth of new data products. More than 33 million objects in the ranges G$\\_{RVS}$ < 14 and 3100 < T$\\_{eff}$ < 14 500, have new determinations of their mean radial velocities based on data collected by Gaia. We provide G$\\_{RVS}$ magnitudes for most sources with radial velocities, and a line broadening parameter is listed for a subset of these. Mean Gaia spectra are made available to the community. The Gaia DR3 catalogue includes about 1 million mean spectra from the radial velocity spectrometer, and about 220 million low-resolution blue and red prism photometer BP/RP mean spectra. The results of the analysis of epoch photometry are provided for some 10 million sources across 24 variability types. Gaia DR3 includes astrophysical parameters and source class probabilities for about 470 million and 1500 million sources, respectively, including stars, galaxies, and quasars. Orbital elements and trend parameters are provided for some 800 000 astrometric, spectroscopic and eclipsing binaries. More than 150 000 Solar System objects, including new discoveries, with preliminary orbital solutions and individual epoch observations are part of this release. Reflectance spectra derived from the epoch BP/RP spectral data are published for about 60 000 asteroids. Finally, an additional data set is provided, namely the Gaia Andromeda Photometric Survey, consisting of the photometric time series for all sources located in a 5.5 degree radius field centred on the Andromeda galaxy. \\textbackslash Conclusions: This data release represents a major advance with respect to Gaia DR2 and Gaia EDR3 because of the unprecedented quantity, quality, and variety of source astrophysical data. To date this is the largest collection of all-sky spectrophotometry, radial velocities, variables, and astrophysical parameters derived from both low- and high-resolution spectra and includes a spectrophotometric and dynamical survey of SSOs of the highest accuracy. The non- single star content surpasses the existing data by orders of magnitude. The quasar host and galaxy light profile collection is the first such survey that is all sky and space based. The astrophysical information provided in Gaia DR3 will unleash the full potential of Gaia's exquisite astrometric, photometric, and radial velocity surveys.}",

      "abstract": "{We explore the kinematic gas properties of six 5.5 < z < 7.4 galaxies in the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES), using high- resolution JWST/NIRSpec multi-object spectroscopy of the rest- frame optical emission lines [OIII] and H{\\ensuremath{\\alpha}}. The objects are small and of low stellar mass ({\\ensuremath{\\sim}}1 kpc; M$\\_{*}$ {\\ensuremath{\\sim}} 10$^{7 {\\ensuremath{-}} 9}$ M$\\_{{\\ensuremath{\\odot}}}$), less massive than any galaxy studied kinematically at z > 1 thus far. The cold gas masses implied by the observed star formation rates are about ten times higher than the stellar masses. We find that their ionised gas is spatially resolved by JWST, with evidence for broadened lines and spatial velocity gradients. Using a simple thin-disc model, we fit these data with a novel forward- modelling software that accounts for the complex geometry, point spread function, and pixellation of the NIRSpec instrument. We find the sample to include both rotation- and dispersion- dominated structures, as we detect velocity gradients of v(r$\\_{e}$){\\ensuremath{\\sim}}100 {\\ensuremath{-}} 150 km s$^{{\\ensuremath{-}}1}$, and we find velocity dispersions of {\\ensuremath{\\sigma}}$\\_{0}$ {\\ensuremath{\\sim}} 30 {\\ensuremath{-}} 70 km s$^{{\\ensuremath{-}}1}$ that are comparable to those at cosmic noon. The dynamical masses implied by these models (M$\\_{dyn}$ {\\ensuremath{\\sim}} 10$^{9 {\\ensuremath{-}} 10}$ M$\\_{{\\ensuremath{\\odot}}}$) are higher than the stellar masses by up to a factor 40, and they are higher than the total baryonic mass (gas + stars) by a factor of {\\ensuremath{\\sim}}3. Qualitatively, this result is robust even if the observed velocity gradients reflect ongoing mergers rather than rotating discs. Unless the observed emission line kinematics is dominated by outflows, this implies that the centres of these galaxies are dominated by dark matter or that star formation is three times less efficient, leading to higher inferred gas masses.}",

These observations constitute the deepest JWST images of a lensing cluster to date, adding to existing deep Hubble Space Telescope (HST) images and the recent JWST Early Release Science and Director's Discretionary Time data taken for this field. The wide field of view of UNCOVER (\\raisebox{-0.5ex}\\textasciitilde45 arcmin$^{2}$) extends beyond the cluster's well-studied central core and reveals a spectacular wealth of prominent lensed features around two massive cluster sub-structures in the north and north-west, where no multiple images were previously known. We identify 75 new multiple images and candidates of 17 sources, 43 of which allow us, for the first time, to constrain the lensing properties and total mass distribution around these extended cluster structures using strong lensing (SL). Our model yields an effective Einstein radius of {\\ensuremath{\\theta}}$\\_{E, main}$ = 23.2 {\\ensuremath{\\pm}} 2.3 arcsec for the main cluster core (for z$\\_{s}$ = 2), enclosing a mass of M(< {\\ensuremath{\\theta}}$\\_{E, main}$) = (7.7 {\\ensuremath{\\pm}} 1.1) {\\texttimes} {}10$^{13}$ M$\\_{{\\ensuremath{\\odot}}}$, and {\\ensuremath{\\theta}}$\\_{E, NW}$ = 13.1 {\\ensuremath{\\pm}} 1.3 arcsec for the newly discovered north-western SL structure enclosing M(< {\\ensuremath{\\theta}}$\\_{E, NW}$) = (2.2 {\\ensuremath{\\pm}} 0.3) {\\texttimes} {}10$^{13}$ M$\\_{{\\ensuremath{\\odot}}}$.

      "abstract": "{A standard practice in extragalactic population studies is the fitting of parametric models to galaxy images. From such fits, key structural parameters of galaxies such as total flux and effective radius (size) can be extracted. One of the most popular parametric forms is that of the S{\\'e}rsic profile, which is flexible enough to reasonably fit the light distribution of nearly all galaxies. Here we present pysersic, a Bayesian framework created to facilitate the inference of structural parameters from galaxy images. Pysersic is written in pure Python, and is built using the jax framework, allowing for just-in-time compilation, auto-differentiation and seamless execution on CPUs, GPUs or TPUs. Inference is performed with the numpyro package using gradient based methods, e.g., No U-Turn Sampling, for efficient and robust posterior estimation in only a few minutes on a modern laptop. Pysersic is designed to have a user-friendly interface, allowing users to fit single or multiple sources in a few lines of code, while also being flexible enough for integration into current and future analysis pipelines. In addition to sampling, pysersic can produce point estimates of the best model via optimization in several seconds, and approximate the posterior via stochastic variational inference. The use of the numpyro probabilistic language provides future extensibility to arbitrary models beyond the S{\\'e}rsic.}",

Preliminary indications have suggested these candidate galaxies may be more massive and abundant than previously thought. However, without confirmed distances, their inferred properties remain uncertain. Here we identify four galaxies located in the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey Near-Infrared Camera imaging with photometric redshifts z of roughly 10-13. These galaxies include the first redshift z > 12 systems discovered with distances spectroscopically confirmed by JWST in a companion paper. Using stellar population modelling, we find the galaxies typically contain 100 million solar masses in stars, in stellar populations that are less than 100 million years old. The moderate star-formation rates and compact sizes suggest elevated star-formation rate surface densities, a key indicator of their formation pathways. Taken together, these measurements show that the first galaxies contributing to cosmic reionization formed rapidly and with intense internal radiation fields.}",

However, IRAC's limited sensitivity has long hindered efforts to study the fainter, more numerous population often thought largely responsible for reionization. Here, we use Cosmic Evolution Early Release Science (CEERS) JWST/NIRCam data to characterize 116 ultraviolet (UV)-faint (median M$\\_{UV}$ = -19.5) z \\raisebox{-0.5ex}\\textasciitilde 6.5-8 galaxies. The spectral energy distributions are typically dominated by young (\\raisebox{-0.5ex}\\textasciitilde10-50 Myr), low-mass (M$\\_{*}$ \\raisebox{-0.5ex}\\textasciitilde {}10$^{8}$ M$\\_{{\\ensuremath{\\odot}}}$) stellar populations, and we find no need for extremely high stellar masses (\\raisebox{-0.5ex}\\textasciitilde{}10$^{11}$ M$\\_{{\\ensuremath{\\odot}}}$). Considering previous studies of UV- bright (M$\\_{UV}$ \\raisebox{-0.5ex}\\textasciitilde -22) z \\raisebox{-0.5ex}\\textasciitilde 7-8 galaxies, we find evidence for a strong (5-10 times) increase in specific star formation rate (sSFR) toward lower luminosities (median sSFR = 103 Gyr$^{-1}$ in CEERS). The larger sSFRs imply a more dominant contribution from OB stars in the relatively numerous UV-faint population, perhaps suggesting that these galaxies are very efficient ionizing agents (median {\\ensuremath{\\xi}}$\\_{ion}$ = 10$^{25.7}$ erg$^{-1}$ Hz). In spite of the much larger sSFRs, we find little increase in [O III] + H {\\ensuremath{\\beta}} equivalent widths towards fainter M$\\_{UV}$ (median {\\ensuremath{\\approx}}780 $\\mathrm{\\mathring{A}}$). If confirmed, this may indicate that a substantial fraction of our CEERS galaxies possess extremely low metallicities ({\\ensuremath{\\lesssim}}3 per cent Z$\\_{{\\ensuremath{\\odot}}}$) where [O III] emission is suppressed. Alternatively, high ionizing photon escape fractions or bursty star formation histories can also weaken the nebular lines in a subset of our sample.

Three prominent galaxy overdensities are observed, one of them at the redshift of the quasar. Galaxies are found within 200 pkpc and 105 km s$^{-1}$ of four known metal absorption-line systems. We focus on the role of the galaxies in ionizing the intergalactic medium (IGM) during the later stages of cosmic reionization and construct the mean Ly{\\ensuremath{\\alpha}} and Ly{\\ensuremath{\\beta}} transmission as a function of distance from the galaxies. At the lowest redshifts in our study, 5.3 < z < 5.7, the IGM transmission rises monotonically with distance from the galaxies, as seen previously at lower redshifts. In contrast, at 5.7 < z < 6.14, the transmission of both Ly{\\ensuremath{\\alpha}} and Ly{\\ensuremath{\\beta}} first increases with distance but then peaks at a distance of 5 cMpc before declining. Finally, in the region 6.15 < z < 6.26, where the additional ionizing radiation from the quasar dominates, the monotonic increase in transmission with distance is reestablished. This result is interpreted to represent evidence that the transmission of the IGM at z \\raisebox{-0.5ex}\\textasciitilde 5.9 toward J0100+2802 results from the ``local'' ionizing radiation of galaxies that dominates over the much-reduced cosmic background.}",

We select 138 galaxies with F150W ‑ F356W > 1.5 mag and F356W < 27.5 mag.

The sample is dominated by disk-like galaxies with remarkable compactness for XELG-z6 (effective radii smaller than 0.4 kpc).

We show that the high densities and low metallicities at this epoch guarantee a high star formation efficiency (SFE) in the most massive dark-matter haloes. Feedback-free starbursts (FFBs) occur when the free-fall time is shorter than \\raisebox{-0.5ex}\\textasciitilde$1\\, {\\rm Myr}$, below the time for low-metallicity massive stars to develop winds and supernovae. This corresponds to a characteristic density of \\raisebox{-0.5ex}\\textasciitilde$3\\!\\times \\!10^3\\, {\\rm cm}^{-3}$. A comparable threshold density permits a starburst by allowing cooling to star-forming temperatures in a free-fall time. The galaxies within \\raisebox{-0.5ex}\\textasciitilde{}10$^{11}$ M$\\_{{\\ensuremath{\\odot}}}$ haloes at z \\raisebox{-0.5ex}\\textasciitilde 10 are expected to have FFB densities. The halo masses allow efficient gas supply by cold streams in a halo crossing time \\raisebox{-0.5ex}\\textasciitilde$80\\, {\\rm Myr}$. The FFBs gradually turn all the accreted gas into stars in clusters of \\raisebox{-0.5ex}\\textasciitilde10$^{4-7}$ M$\\_{{\\ensuremath{\\odot}}}$ within galaxies that are rotating discs or shells. The starbursting clouds are insensitive to radiative feedback and are shielded against feedback from earlier stars.

Low-resolution 1{\\textendash}5 {\\ensuremath{\\mu}}m spectra confirm the presence of molecular features consistent with T dwarf atmospheres, and comparison to spectral standards infers classifications of sdT1, T6, and T8{\\textendash}T9.
