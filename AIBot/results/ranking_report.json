      "abstract": "{JWST has uncovered large numbers of compact galaxies at high redshift with broad hydrogen/helium lines. These include the enigmatic population known as ``little red dots'' (LRDs). Their nature is debated, but they are thought to be powered by supermassive black holes (SMBHs) or intense star formation. They exhibit unusual properties for SMBHs, such as black holes that are overmassive for their host galaxies and extremely weak X-ray and radio emission. Using the highest-quality JWST spectra, we show here that the lines are broadened by electron scattering with a narrow intrinsic line core. The data require high electron column densities and compact sizes (light days), which, when coupled with their high luminosities can only be explained by SMBH accretion. The narrow intrinsic cores of the lines imply upper limits on the black hole masses of $10^{5-7}$ $M\\_{\\odot}$, two orders of magnitude lower than previous estimates. These are among the lowest mass SMBHs known at high redshift and suggest that this is a population of young, rapidly growing SMBHs. They are enshrouded in a dense cocoon of ionized gas, probably related to their youth, from which they are accreting close to the Eddington limit. Reprocessed nebular emission from the dense cocoon dominates the optical spectrum, explaining most LRD spectral characteristics and helping to suppress radio and X-ray emission.}",

      "abstract": "{We present CAPERS-LRD-z9, a little red dot (LRD) that we confirm to be a z = 9.288 broad-line active galactic nucleus (BLAGN). First identified as a high-redshift LRD candidate from PRIMER NIRCam photometry, follow-up NIRSpec/PRISM spectroscopy of CAPERS- LRD-z9 from the CANDELS-Area Prism Epoch of Reionization Survey (CAPERS) has revealed a broad 3500 km s$^{‑1}$ full width at half-maximum H{\\ensuremath{\\beta}} emission line and narrow [O III] {\\ensuremath{\\lambda}}{\\ensuremath{\\lambda}}4959, 5007 lines, indicative of a BLAGN. Based on the broad H{\\ensuremath{\\beta}} line, we compute a canonical black hole mass of log(MBH/M{\\ensuremath{\\odot}})=7.58{\\ensuremath{\\pm}}0.15, although full consideration of systematic uncertainties yields a conservative range of 6.65log(MBH/M{\\ensuremath{\\odot}})8.50. These observations suggest that either a massive black hole seed or a lighter stellar remnant seed undergoing periods of super- Eddington accretion is necessary to grow such a massive black hole in {\\ensuremath{\\lesssim}}500 Myr of cosmic time. CAPERS- LRD-z9 exhibits a strong Balmer break, consistent with a central AGN surrounded by dense ({\\ensuremath{\\sim}}{}10$^{10}$ cm$^{‑3}$) neutral gas. We model CAPERS-LRD-z9 using Cloudy to fit the emission redward of the Balmer break with a dense-gas- enshrouded AGN and bagpipes to fit the rest-ultraviolet emission as a host-galaxy stellar population. This upper limit on the stellar mass of the host galaxy (<{}10$^{9}$ M$\\_{{\\ensuremath{\\odot}}}$) implies that the black hole to stellar mass ratio may be extremely large, possibly >5\\% (although systematic uncertainties on the black hole mass prevent strong conclusions). However, the shape of the UV continuum differs from typical high-redshift star-forming galaxies, indicating that this UV emission may also be of AGN origin; hence, the true stellar mass of the host may be still lower.}",

We report an independent rediscovery of a broad-line active galactic nucleus (AGN), SDSS J102530.29+140207.3, at , which shows spectral features matching those of LRDs seen in the early Universe, including the V-shaped spectrum, broad Balmer lines (with widths of 1000─2000 ), and deep Balmer absorption. We present a new GTC observation of this LRD, which reveals an optical continuum similar to those of G-to-K giant stars including an unambiguous G-band absorption originating from the CH molecule. In addition, this local LRD shows a series of absorption lines potentially related to low-ionization ions or atoms but are deeper than what is observed in empirical stellar templates. We further identify a series of [Fe II] emission lines indicative of low-ionization gas, which we find also present in a JWST-selected LRD at . We find small but statistically significant variability in the H of SDSS J102530.29+140207.3 consistent with previous findings. Finally, we report new observations with NuSTAR.

Leveraging X-ray through far-infrared observations of two of the most luminous known little red dots, we directly measure their bolometric luminosities. We find evidence that more than half of the bolometric luminosity likely emerges in the rest-frame optical, with L$\\_{bol}$/L$\\_{5100}$ = 5, roughly half the value for ``standard'' active galactic nuclei. Meanwhile, the X-ray emitting corona, UV-emitting blackbody, and reprocessed mid to far-infrared emission are all considerably subdominant, assuming that the far-infrared luminosity is well below current measured limits. We present new bolometric corrections that dramatically lower inferred bolometric luminosities by a factor of 10 compared to published values in the literature. These bolometric corrections are in accord with expectations from models in which gas absorption and reprocessing are responsible for the red rest-frame optical colors of little red dots. We discuss how this lowered luminosity scale suggests a lower mass scale for the population by at least an order of magnitude (e.g., {\\ensuremath{\\sim}}{}10$^{5}$─{}10$^{7}$ M$\\_{{\\ensuremath{\\odot}}}$ black holes, and {\\ensuremath{\\sim}}{}10$^{8}$ M$\\_{{\\ensuremath{\\odot}}}$ galaxies), alleviating tensions with clustering, overmassive black holes, and the integrated black hole mass density in the Universe.}",

Many of these objects exhibit signs of active galactic nucleus (AGN) activity, making their study crucial for understanding the formation of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) and their growth with host galaxies. In this work, we examine low and medium-resolution JWST/NIRSpec spectra from the JADES GTO public data release in the GOODS-N field of a red, luminous (M $\\_{B}$ {\\ensuremath{\\sim}} ‑22.2 mag) and compact (<500 pc) source at z = 4.13.

      "abstract": "{We leverage the overmassive black holes ($\\rm M\\_{BH}/M\\_{\\ast} \\approx0.1$) present in a realization of the BRAHMA cosmological hydrodynamic simulation suite to investigate their role in the emission of the unique ``little red dot'' (LRD) objects identified by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). We find that these black holes can produce LRD-like observables when their emission is modeled with a dense gas cloud shrouding the active galactic nucleus (AGN). Between redshifts 5 and 8, we find the number density of LRDs in this simulation to be $\\rm 2.04 \\pm 0.32 \\times 10^{-4} \\space Mpc^{-3}$, which is broadly consistent with current estimates for the total LRD population from JWST. Their emission in the rest-frame visible spectrum is dominated by their AGN, which induces the red color indicative of LRDs via a very strong Balmer break. Additionally, the elevated mass of the black holes reduces the temperature of their accretion discs. This shifts the peak of the AGN emission towards longer wavelengths, and increases their brightness in the rest-frame visible spectrum relative to lower mass black holes accreting at the same rate. These simulated LRDs have very minimal dust attenuation ($\\rm A\\_V = 0.21 \\pm 0.12$), limiting the amount of dust re-emission that would occur in the infrared, making them very likely to fall below the observed detection limits from observatories like the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA). In contrast to the BRAHMA box, the ASTRID simulation produces systematically smaller black holes and predicts LRD number densities that are more than two orders of magnitude lower than current measurements. We therefore conclude that the presence of black holes that are overmassive relative to their host galaxy, and enshrouded in dense gas, is necessary for AGN-dominated LRD models to reproduce both the observed properties and abundances of JWST LRD populations.}",

      "abstract": "{We present a sample of 341 ``little red dots'' (LRDs) spanning the redshift range z {\\ensuremath{\\sim}} 2{\\textendash}11 using data from the CEERS, PRIMER, JADES, UNCOVER, and NGDEEP surveys. Unlike past use of color indices to identify LRDs, we employ continuum slope fitting using shifting bandpasses to sample the same rest-frame emission blueward and redward of the Balmer break. This enables the detection of LRDs over a wider redshift range and with less contamination from galaxies with strong breaks that otherwise lack a rising red continuum. The redshift distribution of our sample increases at z < 8 and then undergoes a rapid decline at z {\\ensuremath{\\sim}} 4.5, which may tie the emergence of these sources to the inside-out growth that galaxies experience during this epoch. We find that LRDs are {\\ensuremath{\\sim}}1 dex more numerous than X-ray- and UV- selected active galactic nuclei (AGN) at z {\\ensuremath{\\sim}} 5{\\textendash}7. Within our sample, we have identified the first two X-ray-detected LRDs. An X-ray spectral analysis confirms that these AGN are moderately obscured with <inline-formula> <mm l:math><mml:mi>log</mml:mi><mml:mspace></mml:mspace><mml:mo>(</m ml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>N</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow ><mml:mi>H</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>/</mml:mo><mml: msup><mml:mrow><mml:mi>cm</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2 </mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:math> </inline-formula>) of <inline-formula> <mml:math><mml:mn>23</mml:mn><mml:mo>.</mml:mo> <mml:msubsup><mml:mrow><mml:mn>3</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><m ml:mo>‑</mml:mo><mml:mn>1.3</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo >+</mml:mo><mml:mn>0.4</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msubsup></mml:ma th> </inline-formula> and <inline-formula> <mml:math><mml:mn>22. 7</mml:mn><mml:msubsup><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow><m ml:mrow><mml:mo>‑</mml:mo><mml:mn>0.16</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:m row><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mn>0.13</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub sup></mml:math> </inline-formula>. Our analysis reveals that reddened AGN emission dominates their rest-optical light, while the rest-UV originates from their host galaxies.

The confirmed AGN fraction of our sample is 71\\% for sources with F444W < 26.5.

      "abstract": "{We use the DAWN JWST Archive to construct and characterise a sample of 116 little red dots (LRDs) across 2.3<z<9.3, selecting all sources with v-shaped UV-optical continua from NIRSpec/PRISM spectra and compact morphologies in NIRCam/F444W imaging. We show that LRD continuum spectra are ubiquitously well described by modified blackbodies across \\raisebox{-0.5ex}\\textasciitilde$0.4-1.0μ$m, with typical T\\raisebox{-0.5ex}\\textasciitilde5000K or $λ\\_{peak}$\\raisebox{-0.5ex}\\textasciitilde$0.65μ$m across 2 dex in luminosity, and a tail toward T\\raisebox{-0.5ex}\\textasciitilde2000K. LRDs therefore trace a locus in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram that is directly analogous to stars on the Hayashi track, strongly supporting the picture that LRDs are AGN embedded in thermalised dense gas envelopes in approximate hydrostatic equilibrium. Hotter LRDs with $λ\\_{peak}<0.65μ$m typically have strong Balmer breaks, redder UV slopes and high optical luminosities; other LRDs show weak or no Balmer breaks, and wide variety in $β\\_{UV}$ and $L\\_{5100}$. Crucially, we demonstrate that the UV-optical continuum shapes and luminosities are strongly linked to the $Hα,\\ Hβ$, [OIII] and OI line properties. There is a tight linear relation between the H$α$ and optical continuum luminosities, as well as H$α$ and OI$\\_{8446}$, indicating that Balmer, OI and optical emission must primarily be powered by the same source. The Balmer decrement increases strongly toward higher $L\\_{Hα}$, $L\\_{5100}$ and Balmer break strength, providing key evidence for luminosity-dependent effects of collisional (de-)excitation and resonant scattering in the gaseous envelopes. In contrast, we show that [OIII] emission likely originates from star-forming host galaxies, and that its strong correlation with Balmer break strength arises naturally from variation in the AGN-to-host ratio. Our work presents an empirical description of the nature and structure of LRDs, defining a new benchmark for ongoing LRD model developments.}",

      "abstract": "{We present a statistical study on the origins of the UV continuum and narrow/broad emission lines in little red dots (LRDs), a newly discovered class of active galactic nuclei (AGNs). Leveraging all archived JWST/NIRSpec data, we build a sample of 28 spectroscopically-confirmed LRDs at $5<z\\_{\\rm spec}<7.2$, by requiring broad H$α$ emission, blue UV colors, V-shaped continua, and compact morphologies. We define a control sample of 9 blue, compact, broad-line AGNs without red optical continua (hereafter little blue dots; LBDs), and examine correlations between rest UV and the narrow/broad H$α$ luminosities in these populations. In LRDs, both narrow and broad H$α$ components are tightly correlated with the UV continuum, and the luminosity ratios are consistent with those in young starburst galaxies. In contrast, the UV to broad H$α$ ratios in LBDs closely match local unobscured AGNs and are statistically different from LRDs. The Ly$α$ occurrence rates and strengths do not differ between LRDs and LBDs and are comparable to normal star-forming galaxies. These results are consistent with a scenario where the central BH in LRDs is enshrouded by a dense opaque gas envelope -- in this model, the UV continuum as well as narrow and even broad H$α$ emissions are not powered by AGNs but predominantly by young massive stars surrounding the envelope, while the envelope radiates as a $\\sim 5000$ K blackbody. As the envelope dissipates, direct AGN emission can emerge, potentially transforming LRDs into LBDs and marking the end of a short-lived phase of rapid black hole growth.}",

      "abstract": "{The JWST discovery of ``little red dots'' (LRDs) is reshaping our picture of the early Universe, yet the physical mechanisms driving their compact size and UV-optical colors remain elusive. Here, we report an unusually bright LRD (z$\\_{spec}$ = 3.1) observed as part of the RUBIES program. This LRD exhibits broad emission lines (FWHM {\\ensuremath{\\sim}} 4000 km s$^{‑1}$), a blue UV continuum, a clear Balmer break, and a red continuum sampled out to rest-frame 4 {\\ensuremath{\\mu}}m with MIRI. We develop a new joint galaxy and active galactic nucleus (AGN) model within the Prospector Bayesian inference framework and perform spectrophotometric modeling using NIRCam, MIRI, and NIRSpec/Prism observations. Our fiducial model reveals a M$\\_{*}$ {\\ensuremath{\\sim}} {}10$^{9}$ M$\\_{{\\ensuremath{\\odot}}}$ galaxy alongside a dust-reddened AGN driving the optical emission. Explaining the rest-frame optical color as a reddened AGN requires A$\\_{V}$ {\\ensuremath{\\gtrsim}} 3, suggesting that a great majority of the accretion disk energy is reradiated as dust emission. Yet, despite clear AGN signatures, we find a surprising lack of hot torus emission, which implies that either the dust emission in this object must be cold, or the red continuum must instead be driven by a massive, evolved stellar population of the host galaxy{\\textemdash}seemingly inconsistent with the high-EW broad lines (H{\\ensuremath{\\alpha}} rest-frame EW {\\ensuremath{\\sim}} 800 {\\r{A}}).

However, the dust-reddened AGN scenario is increasingly challenged by their faint near-to- far-infrared emission and a potential ``dust budget crisis'' in cases when the host galaxy is either undetectably low-mass or absent. In this study, we reevaluate the dust extinction level in LRDs by modeling the UV-to-infrared spectra for various extinction laws and a broad range of dusty distribution parameters. Comparing the predicted infrared fluxes with observational data from JWST MIRI, Herschel, and the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array, our analysis finds that the visual extinction is tightly and consistently constrained to A$\\_{V}$ {\\ensuremath{\\lesssim}} 1.0─1.5 mag for A2744─45924, RUBIES-BLAGN-1, and stacked spectral energy distributions from a large sample of LRDs under the SMC extinction law, with slightly weaker constraints for those with gray extinction in the UV range. The revised A$\\_{V}$ values yield radiative efficiencies of {\\ensuremath{\\sim}}10\\% for the LRD population, easing the tension with the So{\\l}tan argument for the bulk AGN population at lower redshifts.

      "abstract": "{One of JWST's most unexpected discoveries is the emergence of ``Little Red Dots'' (LRDs): compact sources at $z rsim 3$ with blue rest- frame UV continua, red optical slopes, and broad Balmer emission lines that challenge standard models and suggest a population of early, unusual active galactic nuclei (AGNs). Using a comprehensive photometric selection and public NIRSpec/PRISM spectroscopy across six JWST deep fields, we identify a large sample of 118 LRDs with high-S/N spectra, enabling a population- wide analysis of their UV--optical continuum and emission lines. We find clear correlations between rest-frame color ([0.3-0.9\\textbackslash,$μ$m]) and slopes: bluer LRDs have blue UV slopes ($β\\_{ν,\\mathrm{UV}} \\sim 0.3$) and red optical slopes, while redder LRDs exhibit redder UV slopes ($β\\_{ν,\\mathrm{UV}} \\sim 1.1$). The continuum shape shows a similar trend: redder LRDs display prominent Balmer breaks and curvature, while bluer LRDs follow power-law-like optical SEDs. From literature compilations, $\\sim$60\\% of known broad-line AGNs satisfy our LRD criteria, and up to 90\\% of LRDs show broad Balmer lines. Emission-line diagnostics reveal a shift from high H$\\_α$/H$\\_β$ and low [OIII]$\\lambda5007$/H$\\_β$ in redder LRDs to the opposite in bluer ones, along with stronger narrow-line equivalent widths, suggesting a transition from AGN- to host-dominated emission. We fit the spectra with a two-component model combining a gas-enshrouded black hole (BH) and a galaxy host. Redder LRDs require higher-luminosity, unreddened BHs and modestly reddened hosts; bluer LRDs require lower-luminosity, reddened BHs and dust-free galaxies. This framework reproduces the diversity in colors and spectral shape by varying BH luminosity, obscuration, and host-to-BH luminosity ratio.}",

The target is immersed in a 7-kpc wide pool of ionized gas and has three neighbours: a satellite galaxy, a possible satellite/gas cloud, and a tentatively detected spatially detached outflow. H shows strong, rest-frame absorption, deeper than the continuum, ruling out a stellar origin. The velocity and velocity dispersion are and . There is tentative evidence (2.6{\\ensuremath{\\sigma}}) of temporal variability in the equivalent width of the H absorber over two rest-frame months, suggesting a highly dynamic nucleus. Notably, while the H absorber is clearly visible and even dominant in the high-resolution G395H observations, it is not detected in the medium-resolution G395M data of the same epoch. This implies that the current incidence rate of absorbers in LRDs ─ and especially of rest-frame absorbers ─ may be severely underestimated, because most LRDs rely on lower resolution spectroscopy. The high incidence rate of rest-frame absorbers in LRDs may indicate a configuration that is either intrinsically stationary, such as a rotating disc, or that exhibits time- averaged stability, such as an oscillatory 'breathing mode' accretion with cyclic expansion and contraction of the gas around the supermassive black hole.}",

      "abstract": "{The central engines of Little Red Dots (LRDs) may be ``black hole stars'' (BH*s), early stages of black hole growth characterized by dense gas envelopes. So far, the most direct evidence for BH*s comes from a handful of sources where the host galaxy is completely outshone as suggested by their remarkably steep Balmer breaks. Here we present a novel scheme to disentangle BH*s from their host galaxies assuming that the [OIII]5008{\\r{A}} line arises exclusively from the host. Using a sample of 98 LRDs ($z$\\raisebox{-0.5ex}\\textasciitilde$2-9$) with high quality NIRSpec/PRISM spectra, we demonstrate that the host-subtracted median stack displays a Balmer break $>2\\times$ stronger than massive quiescent galaxies, with the rest-optical continuum resembling a blackbody-like SED ($T\\_{\\rm{eff}}$\\raisebox{-0.5ex}\\textasciitilde$4050$ K, $\\log(L\\_{\\rm{bol}})$\\raisebox{-0.5ex}\\textasciitilde$43.9$ erg s$^{-1}$, $R\\_{\\rm{eff}}$\\raisebox{-0.5ex}\\textasciitilde$1300$ au). We measure a steep Balmer decrement (H$α$/H$β>10$) and numerous density-sensitive features (e.g., FeII, HeI, OI). These are hallmark signatures of dense gas envelopes, providing population-level evidence that BH*s indeed power LRDs. In the median LRD, BH*s account for $\\sim20\\%$ of the UV emission, $\\sim50\\%$ at the Balmer break, and $\\sim90\\%$ at wavelengths longer than H$α$ with the remainder arising from the host. BH*s preferentially reside in low-mass galaxies ($M\\_{\\rm{\\star}}$\\raisebox{-0.5ex}\\textasciitilde$10^{8}\\,{\\rm M}\\_{\\rm{\\odot}}$) undergoing recent starbursts, as evidenced by extreme emission line EWs (e.g., [OIII]5008{\\r{A}}\\raisebox{-0.5ex}\\textasciitilde$1100${\\r{A}}, CIII]\\raisebox{-0.5ex}\\textasciitilde$12${\\r{A}}), thereby favoring BH* origins linked to star-formation. We show V-shaped LRD selections are biased to high BH*/host fractions ($rsim60\\%$ at 5500{\\r{A}}) -- less dominant BH*s may be powering JWST's blue broad-line AGN.

Leveraging new JWST/MIRI imaging from the MIDIS and PAHSPECS programs, we confirm Virgil's extraordinary nature among galaxies in JADES/GOODS-South, exhibiting a strikingly red NIRCam-to-MIRI color (F444W─F1500W = 2.84 {\\ensuremath{\\pm}} 0.04 mag). Deep NIRSpec/PRISM spectroscopy from the OASIS program offers key insights into the host galaxy, revealing properties of an average star-forming galaxy during Cosmic Reionization, such as a subsolar metallicity, low-to-moderate dust content, and a relatively high ionization parameter and electron temperature. By estimating the star formation rate of Virgil from UV and H{\\ensuremath{\\alpha}}, we find evidence that the galaxy is either entering or fading out of a bursty episode. Although line-ratio diagnostics employed at high z would classify Virgil as an active galactic nucleus (AGN), this classification becomes ambiguous once redshift evolution is considered. Nonetheless, Virgil occupies the same parameter space as recently confirmed AGNs at similar redshifts. The new deep MIRI data at 15 {\\ensuremath{\\mu}}m reinforce the AGN nature of Virgil, as inferred from multiple spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting codes. Virgil's rising infrared SED and UV excess resemble those of Dust-Obscured Galaxies (DOGs) studied with Spitzer at Cosmic Noon, particularly blue-excess HotDOGs. Our results highlight the need for a multiwavelength approach incorporating MIRI to uncover such extreme sources at z {\\ensuremath{\\gtrsim}} 6 and to shed light on the interplay between galaxy evolution and early black hole growth during Cosmic Reionization.}",

      "abstract": "{Recent James Webb Space Telescope observations have revealed a population of compact extragalactic objects at z {\\ensuremath{\\gtrsim}} 4 with red near-infrared colors, which have been dubbed as ``Little Red Dots'' (LRDs). The spectroscopically selected LRDs exhibit broad H{\\ensuremath{\\alpha}} emission lines, which likely indicate that type I active galactic nuclei (AGNs) are harbored in the galaxies' dust-reddened cores. However, other mechanisms, like strong outflowing winds, could also produce broad H{\\ensuremath{\\alpha}} emission lines, and thus, the nature of LRDs is still under debate. We test the AGN hypothesis for LRDs by stacking the archival Chandra observations of 34 spectroscopically selected LRDs. We obtain tentative detections in the soft (0.5─2 keV) and hard (2─8 keV) X-ray bands with 2.9{\\ensuremath{\\sigma}} and 3.2{\\ensuremath{\\sigma}} significance, and with 4.1{\\ensuremath{\\sigma}} significance when combining the two bands. Nevertheless, we find that the soft (hard) band 3{\\ensuremath{\\sigma}} upper limit is {\\ensuremath{\\sim}}1 dex ({\\ensuremath{\\sim}}0.3 dex) lower than the expected level from the L $\\_{X}$─L $\\_{H{\\ensuremath{\\alpha}} }$ relation for typical type I AGNs. Our results indicate that AGN activity is indeed likely present in LRDs though these objects have significantly different properties compared to previously identified type I AGNs, i.e., LRDs may have intrinsically weak X-ray emissions. We find it difficult to explain the low L $\\_{X}$/L $\\_{H{\\ensuremath{\\alpha}} }$ ratios observed in LRDs solely by absorption. It is also unlikely that fast outflows have major contributions to the broad H{\\ensuremath{\\alpha}} lines. Our findings indicate that empirical relations (e.g., for black hole mass measurements) established for typical type I AGNs should be used with caution when analyzing the properties of LRDs.}",

The spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of this LRD pair show evidence of a Balmer break, consistent with a recent ({\\ensuremath{\\sim}}100 Myr) quenching of star formation. In contrast, the satellites are compatible with a recent-onset ({\\ensuremath{\\sim}}100 Myr), ongoing burst of star formation. LRD1's SED is consistent with a dust-free active galactic nucleus (AGN) being the source of the UV excess in the galaxy. The optical continuum would be powered by the emission from an obscured post-starburst and the AGN at a subdominant level. LRD2's SED is more ambiguous, but it could also be indicative of a dust-free AGN. In this scenario, these LRDs would be massive (M$\\_{{\\ensuremath{\\star}}}$ {\\ensuremath{\\sim}} {}10$^{10}$ M$\\_{{\\ensuremath{\\odot}}}$) and dusty (A(V) > 1 mag) and the three satellites would be lower- mass objects (M$\\_{{\\ensuremath{\\star}}}$ {\\ensuremath{\\sim}} 10$^{8 ‑ 9}$ M$\\_{{\\ensuremath{\\odot}}}$) subject to low dust attenuations.

      "title": "{No Luminous Little Red Dots: A Sharp Cutoff in Their Luminosity Function}",
      "abstract": "{One of the most surprising results of early James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) observations is the discovery of an abundance of red, compact, broad-line objects dubbed ``little red dots'' (LRDs) at $z>4$. Their spatial density ($\\sim10^{-4}$-$10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{cMpc^{-3}}$) is 100 times more abundant than UV-selected quasars at those redshift if one extrapolates the quasar luminosity function (QLF) down to the LRD regime. However, whether LRDs dominate black hole accretion at quasar-like luminosities ($L\\_\\mathrm{bol}rsim 10^{45-46}\\,\\mathrm{erg\\,s^{-1}}$) remains unanswered, as probing the bright end of the LRD luminosity function requires a much larger area than those able to be surveyed by JWST. In this work, we present our search for the brightest LRDs ($K<23.7$) at $4.5<z<4.9$ using wide-area multiwavelength imaging surveys from the near-UV to the infrared bands. With over 15 square degrees of sky coverage, we only identify one single LRD candidate at $z\\_\\mathrm{phot}\\approx4.6$, which translates into a spatial density of $n(M\\_{5100}<-23.5)\\approx10^{-8}\\,\\mathrm{cMpc^{-3}}$ -- this is nearly 10 times less abundant than the UV-selected quasars at similar optical luminosity. When combined with the LRD sample identified by JWST at the same redshift range, we find a sharp cutoff in the optical luminosity function at $λL\\_{5100}\\approx2.5\\times10^{44}\\,\\mathrm{erg\\,s^{-1}}$, while the QLF turnover occurs at $rsim20$ times higher luminosity. We therefore confirm the exclusively low-luminosity nature of LRDs, ruling out that LRDs are the counter parts of quasars. Furthermore, we speculate that, if the shape of the luminosity function holds up, it points to LRDs being powered by low-mass black holes with a narrow range of Eddington-level accretion rates.}",

Several theoretical scenarios have been proposed to seed and rapidly grow black holes, but direct observations of these mechanisms remain elusive. Here we present a source 660 million years after the Big Bang that displays singular properties: among the largest Hydrogen Balmer breaks reported at any redshift, broad multi-peaked H$\\beta$ emission, and Balmer line absorption in multiple transitions. We model this source as a ``black hole star'' (BH*) where the Balmer break and absorption features are a result of extremely dense, turbulent gas forming a dust-free ``atmosphere'' around a supermassive black hole. This source may provide evidence of an early black hole embedded in dense gas -- a theoretical configuration proposed to rapidly grow black holes via super- Eddington accretion. Radiation from the BH* appears to dominate almost all observed light, leaving limited room for contribution from its host galaxy. We demonstrate that the recently discovered ``Little Red Dots'' (LRDs) with perplexing spectral energy distributions can be explained as BH*s embedded in relatively brighter host galaxies. This source provides evidence that black hole masses in the LRDs may be over-estimated by orders of magnitude -- the BH* is effectively dust-free contrary to the steep dust corrections applied while modeling LRDs, and the physics that gives rise to the complex line shapes and luminosities may deviate from assumptions underlying standard scaling relations.}",

At z > 6, our sample includes a high fraction of ``little red dots'' (LRDs; NIRCam- selected dust-reddened active galactic nucleus (AGN) candidates). We significantly measure older stellar populations in the LRDs out to rest-frame 3 {\\ensuremath{\\mu}}m (the stellar bump) and rule out a dominant contribution from hot dust emission, a signature of AGN contamination to stellar population measurements. This allows us to measure their contribution to the cosmic census at z > 3, below the typical detection limits of ALMA (L $\\_{IR}$ < 10$^{12 }$ L $\\_{{\\ensuremath{\\odot}}}$). We find that these sources, which are overwhelmingly missed by HST and ALMA, could effectively double the obscured fraction of the star formation rate density at 4 < z < 6 compared to some estimates, showing that prior to JWST, the obscured contribution from fainter sources could be underestimated. Finally, we identify five sources with evidence for Balmer breaks and high stellar masses at 5.5 < z < 7.7. While spectroscopy is required to determine their nature, we discuss possible measurement systematics to explore with future data.}",

      "abstract": "{We report the discovery of a doubly-imaged Little Red Dot (LRD) candidate behind the galaxy cluster Abell 383, which we dub A383-LRD1. Initially classified as a dropout galaxy in HST imaging with several ground-based emission line detections placing it at $z\\_{\\mathrm{spec}}=6.027$, new JWST/NIRCam observations taken as part of the cycle 4 VENUS survey now reveal that the source consists of two underlying components: A red point-source with a V-shaped SED consistent with LRD selection criteria, and a nearby ($\\sim 380$ pc) compact blue companion which was the main contributor to the previous rest- frame UV detections. Based on lensing symmetry and its SED, the LRD appears to lie at a similar redshift as well. The magnification of the two images of A383-LRD1 is $μ\\_{\\mathrm{A}}=16.2\\pm1.2$ and $μ\\_\\mathrm{B}=9.0\\pm0.6$, respectively, and the predicted time delay between them is $Δt\\_{\\mathrm{grav}}=5.20\\pm0.14$ yr ($\\sim0.7$ yr in the rest- frame). After correcting for the lensing magnification, we derive an absolute magnitude of $M\\_{\\mathrm{UV,LRD}}=-16.8\\pm 0.3$ for the LRD, and $M\\_{\\mathrm{UV,BC}}=-18.2\\pm 0.2$ for the blue companion. We perform SED fits to both components, revealing the LRD to be best fitted with a black hole star (BH*) model and a substantial host galaxy, and the blue companion with an extremely young, emission-line dominated star-forming nebula. A383-LRD1 represents the second known multiply-imaged LRD detected to date, following A2744-QSO1, and to our knowledge, the first LRD system with a confirmed detection of [C $\\_{II}$]$\\lambda158 \\ μ$m emission from ALMA observations.

Here, we show that LRD spectra are naturally reproduced by emission from an accreting Direct Collapse Black Hole (DCBH). Using radiation- hydrodynamic simulations, we follow the growth of the DCBH seed via a dense, compressionally heated, collisionally ionized accretion flow. The model self-consistently reproduces the screen responsible for the observed Balmer absorption, while allowing UV/optical emission to partially escape, along with reprocessed infrared radiation. Crucially, this structure is not a blackbody and requires no stellar contribution: the UV continuum originates entirely from reprocessed DCBH radiation, attenuated only by a small amount of dust with an extinction curve consistent with high-redshift galaxies. This single framework simultaneously explains the key observational puzzles of LRDs: (a) weak X-ray emission, (b) metal and high-ionization lines alongside absent star-formation features, (c) overmassive black holes, (d) compact morphology, (e) abundance and redshift evolution -- linking them directly to pristine atomic-cooling halos, (f) long-lived ($>100$ Myr), slowly variable phases driven by radiation pressure.

      "abstract": "{The nature of Little Red Dots (LRDs) has largely been investigated through their continuum emission, with lines assumed to arise from a broad-line region. In this paper, we instead use recombination lines to infer the intrinsic properties of the central engine of LRDs. Our analysis first reveals a tension between the ionizing properties implied from H$α$ and HeII$\\,λ$4686. The high H$α$ EWs require copious H-ionizing photons, more than the bluest AGN ionizing spectra can provide. In contrast, HeII emission is marginally detected, and its low EW is, at most, consistent with the softest AGN spectra. The low HeII/H$β$ ($\\sim10^{-2}$, $<20\\times$ local AGN median) further points to an unusually soft ionizing spectrum. We extend our analysis to dense gas environments (the ``black-hole star'' hypothesis), and find that hydrogen recombination lines become optically thick and lose diagnostic power, but HeII remains optically thin and a robust tracer. Photoionization modeling with Cloudy rules out standard AGN accretion disk spectra. Alternative explanations include: exotic AGN with red rest- optical emission; a very high \\{\\textbackslashit average\\} optical depth ($>10$) from gas/dust; and/or soft ionizing spectra with abundant H-ionizing photons, consistent with e.g., a cold accretion disk or a composite of AGN and stars. The latter is an intriguing scenario since high hydrogen densities are highly conducive for star formation, and nuclear star clusters are found in the immediate vicinity of local massive black holes. While previous studies have mostly focused on features dominated by the absorbing hydrogen cloud, the HeII- based diagnostic proposed here represents a crucial step toward understanding the central engine of LRDs.}",

Here, we explore the possibility that these sources are globular clusters in formation, with rest-frame UV arising from a very young stellar population and rest-frame optical from a short-lived supermassive ($>10^4$ M$\\_\\odot$) star. The spectral profiles of LRDs are broadly consistent with this scenario, though the observed temperatures and bolometric luminosities favor emission reprocessed by optically thick, continuum-driven winds not fully captured by current models. The LRD $z\\sim5-7$ UV luminosity function naturally evolves, under standard evolutionary and mass-loss prescriptions, into a present-day mass function with a turnover at $\\log\\_{10}(M\\_\\ast$/$M\\_\\odot)=5.3$ and an exponential cutoff at high masses, consistent with local globular-cluster populations. We estimate the total present-day number density of LRDs formed across all redshifts to be $\\approx0.3$ Mpc$^{-3}$, similar to local globular clusters. The observed LRD redshift range matches the age distribution of metal-poor globular clusters, without current LRD counterparts to the metal-rich population. If LRDs are globular clusters in formation, we predict chemical abundance patterns characteristic of multiple stellar populations, including enhanced He and N, and potential Na-O and Al-Mg anti-correlations.

      "abstract": "{The origin of the rest-optical emission of compact, red, high-redshift sources known as little red dots (LRDs) poses a major puzzle. If interpreted as starlight, it would imply that LRDs constitute the densest stellar systems in the Universe. However, alternative models suggest active galactic nuclei (AGN) may instead power the rest-optical continuum. Here, we present JWST/NIRSpec, NIRCam, and MIRI observations from the RUBIES and PRIMER programs of The Cliff: a bright LRD at z = 3.55 with an exceptional Balmer break, twice as strong as that of any high- redshift source previously observed. The spectra also reveal broad hydrogen (H{\\ensuremath{\\alpha}} FWHM {\\ensuremath{\\sim}} 1500 km s$^{‑1}$) and He I emission, but no significant metal lines. We demonstrate that massive evolved stellar populations cannot explain the observed spectrum, even when considering unusually steep and strong dust attenuation or reasonable variations in the initial mass function. Moreover, the formally best-fit stellar mass and compact size (M$\\_{*}$ {\\ensuremath{\\sim}} 10$^{10.5}$ M$\\_{{\\ensuremath{\\odot}}}$, r$\\_{e}$ {\\ensuremath{\\sim}} 40 pc) would imply densities at which near-monthly stellar collisions might lead to significant X-ray emission. We argue that the Balmer break, emission lines, and H{\\ensuremath{\\alpha}} absorption line are instead most plausibly explained by a black hole star (BH$^{*}$) scenario, in which dense gas surrounds a powerful ionising source. In contrast to recently proposed BH$^{*}$ models of dust-reddened AGN, we show that spectral fits in the rest UV to near-infrared favour an intrinsically redder continuum over strong dust reddening. This may point to a super-Eddington accreting massive black hole or, possibly, the presence of (super)massive stars in a nuclear star cluster. The Cliff is the clearest evidence to date that at least some LRDs are not ultra-dense massive galaxies, and are instead powered by a central ionising source embedded in dense, absorbing gas.}",

However, the lack of observed far-infrared (FIR) emission has proved difficult to reconcile with the implied attenuated luminosity in these models. Here, we utilize deep new Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array imaging, new and existing JWST/MIRI imaging, and archival Spitzer/Herschel imaging of two of the rest-optically brightest LRDs (z = 3.1 and z = 4.47) to place the strongest constraints on the IR luminosity in LRDs to date. The detections at {\\ensuremath{\\lambda}}$\\_{rest}$ = 1{\\textendash}4 {\\ensuremath{\\mu}}m imply flat slopes in the rest-IR, ruling out a contribution from hot (T {\\ensuremath{\\gtrsim}} 500 K) dust. Similarly, FIR nondetections rule out any appreciable cold (T {\\ensuremath{\\lesssim}} 75 K) dust component. Assuming energy balance, these observations are inconsistent with the typical FIR dust emission of dusty starbursts and quasar tori, which usually show a mixture of cold and hot dust. Additionally, our [C II] nondetections rule out typical dusty starbursts. We compute empirical maximum IR SEDs and find that both LRDs must have log(LIR/L{\\ensuremath{\\odot}}){\\ensuremath{\\lesssim}}12.2 at the 3{\\ensuremath{\\sigma}} level. These limits are in tension with the predictions of rest-optical spectrophotometric fits, be they galaxy-only, AGN-only, or composite. It is unlikely that LRDs are highly dust-reddened intrinsically blue sources with a dust temperature distribution that conspires to avoid current observing facilities.

Most of the LRDs with existing spectral observations exhibit broad Balmer lines and are thus likely to host active galactic nuclei (AGNs). Here we present a study of LRDs with no broad H-alpha component. Our sample consists of five LRDs at z\\raisebox{-0.5ex}\\textasciitilde5 with H-alpha line widths of about 250 km/s. They are selected from 32 LRDs that have NIRSpec high- or medium-resolution grating spectra covering H-alpha. During our construction of the sample, we find that approximately 20 percent of the LRD candidates previously selected do not show red continuum emission but resemble the V-shape spectra due to strong line emission. Compared to normal star-forming galaxies, narrow-line LRDs tend to have relatively higher H-alpha line widths and luminosities. If these LRDs are dominated by galaxies, our SED modeling suggests that they are dusty, compact star-forming galaxies with high stellar masses and star formation rates (SFRs). Alternatively, if their SEDs are produced by AGNs, the inferred central black hole masses (MBH) are in the range of 10\\^5 to 10\\^6 solar masses, placing them at the low-mass end of the AGN population. They may represent an early stage of super-Eddington growth, where the black holes have yet to accumulate significant masses. With large measurement uncertainties, these black holes appear slightly overmassive relative to the local MBH-Mstar relation, but consistent or undermassive with respect to the MBH-sigma and MBH-Mdyn relations.

      "abstract": "{We present the deepest medium-resolution JWST/NIRSpec spectroscopy to date of a bright Little Red Dot (LRD) AGN, Irony at z=6.68. The data reveal broad Balmer emission from H$α$-H$δ$ and Balmer absorption in H$α$-H$ε$. The absorption lines are kinematically split: H$α$ is blueshifted while higher-order lines are redshifted suggesting complex gas kinematics; their relative ratios are inconsistent with a single, passive absorbing screen. The line depths require absorption of both the BLR and the continuum, ruling out a stellar origin, consistent with the smooth Balmer break. We fit the broad H$γ$-H$α$ lines and find the data favor a double-Gaussian effective profile, although exponential wings are evident. Depending on the adopted profile, single-epoch virial estimates give log(M$\\_\\bullet$/M$\\_\\odot$)=7.86-8.39 and $λ\\_{\\rm Edd}$=1.7-0.4. The dynamical mass implied by the narrow lines is low log(Mdyn/M$\\_\\odot$)=9.1, suggesting an overmassive black hole. The narrow lines display little attenuation, A$\\_V<0.5$ mag; while broad H$α$/H$β\\sim9$ and the broad Balmer decrements are inconsistent with standard dust attenuation curves, suggesting collisional processes. The forbidden-line spectrum includes auroral [S II] and [N II], and a forest of [Fe II] lines. Line ratios and kinematics indicate a stratified narrow-line region with both low (n$\\_{\\rm e}$=420 cm$^{-3}$) and high densities (n$\\_{\\rm e}rsim 6.3\\times10^5$ cm$^{-3}$). We detect metal absorption lines in both the optical (Ca II and Na I) and UV range (Fe II UV1-UV3). Our results support a picture of a compact AGN embedded in a dense, high covering-factor and stratified cocoon, with complex neutral-gas kinematics. While the choice of broad-line profile affects the virial estimates of M$\\_\\bullet$, we find the effect to be of order 0.6 dex between the different approaches.}",

The physical nature of these LRDs is unclear, and it remains debated whether the peculiar spectral shape originates from AGN, compact galaxies, or both. We present the analysis of new NIRSpec-IFU data from the BlackTHUNDER JWST Large Programme and archival NIRSpec-MSA data of a lensed LRD at . The spectra confirm the presence of a smooth Balmer break and a broad H tracing the Broad Line Region (BLR) of an AGN. The small velocity dispersion of the H narrow component indicates a small dynamical mass of the host galaxy of , which implies that the stellar population cannot contribute more than 10 per cent to the optical continuum. We show that the Balmer break can be well described by an AGN continuum absorbed by very dense () and nearly dust-free gas along our line of sight (possibly gas in the BLR or its surrounding). The same gas is expected to produce H absorption, at a level consistent with a tentative detection () in the high-resolution spectrum. Such a non-stellar origin of the Balmer break may apply to other LRDs, and would alleviate the issue of extremely high stellar mass surface densities inferred in the case of a stellar interpretation of the Balmer break. We note that this is a rare case of a black hole that is overmassive relative to both the host galaxy stellar and dynamical masses.

      "abstract": "{JWST has revealed a population of compact ``Little Red Dots'' (LRDs) at z {\\ensuremath{\\gtrsim}} 4, with red rest-frame optical and blue UV colors. These objects are likely compact dusty starbursts or heavily reddened AGNs, playing a pivotal role in early black hole growth, dust production, and stellar assembly. We introduce a new photometric selection to identify LRDs over a broad range in redshifts and rest-frame UV to near-IR (NIR) colors enabling a more complete census of the population. This method identifies 248 LRDs with F444W < 27 mag over 263 arcmin$^{2}$ in the JADES, PRIMER-COSMOS, and PRIMER-UDS fields with MIRI coverage, increasing the number density by 1.7{\\texttimes} compared to previous samples, suggesting that previous censuses were underestimated. Most LRDs are detected in MIRI/F770W but only 7\\% (17) are detected in F1800W. We use MIRI-based rest-frame [1 ─ 3 {\\ensuremath{\\mu}}m] colors to trace dust emission. F1800W-detected LRDs have a median [1 ─ 3 {\\ensuremath{\\mu}}m] = 1.5 mag, with a broad scatter indicative of diverse dust emission properties. About 20\\% exhibit colors [1 ─ 3 {\\ensuremath{\\mu}}m] < 1 mag consistent with negligible dust emission, but the majority show significant dust emission at 3 {\\ensuremath{\\mu}}m (f3{\\ensuremath{\\mu}}mdust{\\ensuremath{\\lesssim}}0.8) from the galaxy's interstellar medium or a hot-dust-deficient active galactic nucleus torus. The correlation between bluer UV to NIR colors and stronger IR emission suggests that the bluest LRDs may resemble unobscured QSOs.

The LRDs have red NIRCam colors, F150W-F444W > 1, but flat NIRCam-MIRI colors, -0.5 < F444W - F770W < 0.5, suggesting weak warm/hot dust components. The LRDs have -1.0 < F1000W - F1500W < 1.1, suggestive of non-uniform rest near-IR properties within the sample. We model the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of the LRDs using the CIGALE and Prospector codes to assess how the differing templates impact the interpretation for LRDs for cases of: (1) models with star-forming stellar populations only; (2) active galactic nuclei (AGN) dominated models; and (3) composite AGN and star-forming models. Using the Bayesian information criterion, we find that six of the eight LRDs favor AGN models compared to star-forming models, though no model can fully reproduce all of the observed properties. Two LRDs with pronounced Balmer-breaks and broad H$\\_α$ have SEDs that can be reproduced with hot, dense-gas (log T/K=5-5.7, log n/cm$^{-3}$ = 9-11) models with low dust attenuation (A(V)\\raisebox{-0.5ex}\\textasciitilde 0.5mag). However, these models require an additional thermal component (800-1400K) to account for the MIRI data, and fail to reproduce the rest-UV and narrow [OIII] emission. The total bolometric emission from the dense-gas models, and possibly CIGALE AGN models, appear consistent with literature constraints in the far-IR and radio, and require log L$\\_{bol}$/L$\\_\\odot$ <12.

The relative contribution of galaxy starlight and AGN to these systems remains uncertain, especially for the galaxies with unusual blue+red spectral energy distributions. In this work, we use Balmer decrements to measure the independent dust attenuation of the broad and narrow emission-line components of a sample of 29 broad-line AGN identified from three public JWST spectroscopy surveys: CEERS, JADES, and RUBIES. Stacking the narrow components from the spectra of 25 sources with broad H{\\ensuremath{\\alpha}} and no broad H{\\ensuremath{\\beta}} results in a median narrow H{\\ensuremath{\\alpha}}/H{\\ensuremath{\\beta}} = <inline-formula> <mml:math><mml:mn>2.4</mml:mn><mml:msubsup><mml:mrow><mml:mn>7</ mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>‑</mml:mo><mml:mn>0.05</mml: mn></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mn>0.05</mml:mn>< /mml:mrow></mml:msubsup></mml:math> </inline-formula> (consistent with A$\\_{v}$ = 0) and broad H{\\ensuremath{\\alpha}}/H{\\ensuremath{\\beta}} >8.85 (A$\\_{v}$ > 3.63). The narrow and broad Balmer decrements imply little to no attenuation of the narrow emission lines, which are consistent with being powered by star formation and located on larger physical scales. Meanwhile, the lower limit in the broad H{\\ensuremath{\\alpha}}/H{\\ensuremath{\\beta}} decrement, with broad H{\\ensuremath{\\beta}} undetected in the stacked spectrum of 25 broad H{\\ensuremath{\\alpha}} AGN, implies significant dust attenuation of the broad-line emitting region that is presumably associated with the central AGN. Our results indicate that these systems, on average, are consistent with heavily dust-attenuated AGN powering the red parts of their SED, while their blue UV emission is powered by unattenuated star formation in the host galaxy.}",

Many LRDs exhibit broad Balmer lines and thus likely host active galactic nuclei (AGNs). Here we present a study of five LRDs without broad H{\\ensuremath{\\alpha}} lines at z {\\ensuremath{\\geq}} 5. They are selected from 32 LRDs that have NIRSpec high- or medium- resolution grating spectra covering H{\\ensuremath{\\alpha}}, and their H{\\ensuremath{\\alpha}} line widths are around 250 km s$^{{\\ensuremath{-}}1}$. Compared to normal star-forming galaxies, narrow-line LRDs tend to have relatively higher H{\\ensuremath{\\alpha}} line widths and luminosities. If they are dominated by galaxies, our SED modeling suggests that they are dusty, compact star-forming galaxies with high stellar masses and star formation rates. Alternatively, if their SEDs are produced by AGNs, the inferred black hole masses (<{}10$^{6}$ M$\\_{{\\ensuremath{\\odot}}}$) place them at the low-mass end of the AGN population. They may represent an early stage of super- Eddington growth, where the black holes have yet to accumulate significant masses. With large uncertainties, these black holes appear slightly overmassive relative to the local M$\\_{BH}$─M$\\_{*}$relation, but consistent or undermassive with respect to the M$\\_{BH}$─{\\ensuremath{\\sigma}}$\\_{stellar}$ and M$\\_{BH}$─M$\\_{dyn}$ relations. These narrow-line LRDs offer new insights into the diversity of LRDs. Finally, we find that {\\ensuremath{\\sim}}44\\% of high-redshift broad-line AGNs exhibit V-shaped SEDs.

These so-called ``little red dots'' (LRDs) often exhibit broad Balmer emission lines, indicative of the presence of active galactic nuclei (AGNs). They generally lack detection of X-ray, radio, and mid-IR radiation, which is fundamentally different from typical AGNs. Various models, including super-Eddington- accreting black holes enshrouded in dense and dust-poor gas, have been proposed to explain these features. However, the nature of LRDs remains debated, and their evolutionary fate is unclear. Here we report two unusual LRDs at redshift z = 2.868 and 2.925 that are in a transitional phase towards typical AGNs. Their V-shaped SEDs, compact optical morphology, and broad emission lines satisfy the defining criteria of LRDs. On the other hand, they exhibit intense X-ray, radio, and mid-IR radiation that is much stronger than previously known LRDs. These hybrid properties suggest that the dense gas envelope around their central black holes is dispersing, allowing high- energy photons and radio emission to escape. Meanwhile, a dust torus is forming. This finding provides a direct insight into the nature of LRDs and indicates that at least some LRDs will evolve into AGNs or quasars at later times.}",

Among these `Little Red Dots' (LRDs), Abell2744-QSO1 at $z=7.04$ has been confirmed to have time-variable equivalent width (EW) in its broad emission lines, confirming its AGN nature. We extend the analysis of NIRSpec/IFS data from the BlackTHUNDER survey to the H$\\alpha$ line. The broad-line profile in Abell2744-QSO1 is manifestly non-Gaussian, requiring at least two Gaussian components with full width at half maximum FWHM=$450\\pm50$ and $1800\\pm100$ km s$^{-1}$. Crucially, we also detect a narrow-line Gaussian component, and strong H$\\alpha$ absorption (EW relative to the continuum $\\approx 30^{+15}\\_{-9}$ A), confirming a connection between the strong Balmer break and line absorption. The absorber is at rest with respect to broad H$\\alpha$, suggesting that the gas cannot be interpreted as an inflow or outflow, forming instead a long-lived structure. Its velocity dispersion is $\\sigma\\_{abs} = 100\\pm10$ km s$^{-1}$, consistent with the value inferred from the analysis of the Balmer break. Based on H$\\alpha$, we infer a black hole mass of log(M$\\_{BH}$/M$\\_\\odot$)=6.3-6.7, 0.9-1.3 dex smaller than previous estimates based on H$\\beta$. The Eddington ratio is 0.7-1.6.

      "title": "{A Black-Hole Envelope Interpretation for Cosmological Demographics of Little Red Dots}",
      "abstract": "{Little red dots (LRDs) newly discovered with JWST are active galactic nuclei (AGN) that may represent black hole (BH) growth at the earliest cosmic epochs. These sources show puzzling features unlike typical AGNs, including red optical continua, weak hot- dust emission, and a lack of detectable X-rays. Previously, LRDs have often been interpreted as dust-reddened AGNs, leading to severe inconsistencies with the luminosity and BH mass densities inferred for previously known AGNs over $0<z<5$. The BH-envelope (BHE) model has been proposed to explain these characteristics, in which an accreting BH is enshrouded by a dense, optically thick gaseous envelope. In this Letter, we reanalyze the SEDs of $\\sim 400$ photometric LRDs in the COSMOS-Web survey using the BHE model and reassess their implications for cosmological BH evolution. We find that the optical-NIR spectra of LRDs are well reproduced by blackbody emission with an effective temperatures of $4000-6000\\textasciitilde \\K$. Within the BHE framework, the inferred bolometric luminosities decrease by $rsim1-2$ orders of magnitude compared to dust-reddened AGN assumptions. As a result, the revised luminosity function, BH accretion density, and BH mass function become consistent with those of AGNs at $z<5$. The stellar masses of LRD hosts are estimated by attributing the UV excesses to star formation. Although the resulting $M\\_{\\rm BH}/M\\_\\star$ ratio remains higher than the local empirical value, the excess is modest. Overall, the BHE model not only resolves the spectral features of LRDs but also brings their statistical properties into agreement with the broader cosmological BH population.}",

One remarkable distinction of these JWST-identified AGNs, compared to their low-redshift counterparts, is that at least {\\ensuremath{\\sim}}20\\% of them present H{\\ensuremath{\\alpha}} and/or H{\\ensuremath{\\beta}} absorption, which must be associated with extremely dense ({\\ensuremath{\\gtrsim}}{}10$^{9}$ cm$^{‑3}$) gas in the broad- line region or its immediate surroundings. These Balmer absorption features unavoidably imply the presence of a Balmer break caused by the same dense gas. In this Letter, we quantitatively demonstrate that a Balmer break can form in AGN spectra without stellar components, when the accretion disk is heavily embedded in dense neutral gas clumps with densities of {\\ensuremath{\\sim}}10$^{9‑11}$ cm$^{‑3}$, where hydrogen atoms are collisionally excited to the n = 2 states and effectively absorb the AGN continuum at the bluer side of the Balmer limit. The nonstellar origin of a Balmer break offers a potential solution to the large stellar masses and densities inferred for little red dots (LRDs) when assuming that their continuum is primarily due to stellar light. Our calculations indicate that the observed Balmer absorption blueshifted by a few hundred km s$^{‑1}$, which suggests the presence of dense outflows in the nucleus at rates exceeding the Eddington value. Other spectral features such as higher equivalent widths of broad H{\\ensuremath{\\alpha}} emission and presence of O I lines observed in high-redshift AGNs including LRDs align with the predicted signatures of a dense super-Eddington accretion disk.}",

      "abstract": "{Little Red Dots (LRDs) are a newly identified class of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) uncovered by JWST deep surveys. Their enigmatic properties challenge the canonical AGN paradigm and have stimulated ideas on early massive black hole (BH) formation. In this review, we summarize how early BHs shape the characteristic features of LRDs, how their nuclear environments differ from those of normal AGNs, and how future observations can distinguish between competing scenarios. Our main conclusions are as follows: (1) LRDs show broad-line emission consistent with mass accretion onto BHs with $M\\_{\\rm BH}\\simeq 10^{6-7}\\textasciitilde M\\_\\odot$, suggesting that AGN activity is a plausible origin of their dominant red optical emission. (2) Stellar components can reproduce the continuum energetics through dusty star formation. However, the required stellar mass would be too large to remain consistent with other LRD properties. Therefore, a purely stellar origin is unlikely to be the dominant power source, although star formation may still contribute to the UV emission. (3) The coexistence of broad-line emission with Balmer absorption and break features on LRD spectra, neither of which can be explained by stellar populations, suggests that nuclear BHs are enshrouded by dense gas with a high covering fraction. (4) Gas-enshrouded AGNs can produce red optical spectra without requiring dust reddening through a combination of gas attenuation and thermal self-emission with an effective temperature of $T\\_{\\rm eff}\\simeq 5000\\textasciitilde {\\rm K}$, which also accounts for the flat infrared continuum. (5) From the spectral features and redshift evolution, LRDs are likely a transient phase in early BH growth, possibly the first accretion episodes of newborn BHs. (6) Testing models for LRD spectra and origins through time variability, ionizing sources, post-LRD objects, and low-redshift analogs is particularly promising.}",

      "abstract": "{The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has unveiled numerous massive black holes (BHs) in faint, broad-line active galactic nuclei (AGNs). The discovery highlights the presence of dust-reddened AGN populations, referred to as ``little red dots (LRDs),'' more abundant than X-ray-selected AGNs, which are less influenced by obscuration. This finding indicates that the cosmic growth rate of BHs within this population does not decrease but rather increases at higher redshifts beyond z {\\ensuremath{\\sim}} 6. The BH accretion rate density deduced from their luminosity function is remarkably higher than that from other AGN surveys in X-ray and infrared bands. To align the cumulative mass density accreted to BHs with the observed BH mass density at z ≃ 4{\\textendash}5, as derived from the integration of the BH mass function, the radiative efficiency must be doubled from the canonical 10\\% value, achieving significance beyond the >3{\\ensuremath{\\sigma}} confidence level. This suggests the presence of rapid spins with 96\\% of the maximum limit among these BHs under the thin-disk approximation, maintained by prolonged mass accretion instead of chaotic accretion with randomly oriented inflows. Moreover, we derive an upper bound for the stellar mass of galaxies hosting these LRDs, ensuring consistency with galaxy formation in the standard cosmological model, where the host stellar mass is limited by the available baryonic reservoir. Our analysis gives a lower bound for the BH- to-galaxy mass ratio that exceeds the typical value known in the nearby universe and aligns with that for JWST-detected unobscured AGNs. Accordingly, we propose a hypothesis that the dense, dust-rich environments within LRDs facilitate the emergence of rapidly spinning and overmassive BH populations during the epoch of reionization. This scenario predicts a potential association between relativistic jets and other high- energy phenomena with overmassive BHs in the early universe.}",

Their spectra exhibit broad Balmer emission lines (), alongside absorption features and a pronounced Balmer break ─ evidence for a dense, neutral hydrogen medium, in which the state is significantly populated. When interpreted as arising from active galactic nucleus broad-line regions, inferred black hole masses from local scaling relations exceed expectations given their stellar masses, challenging models of early black hole─galaxy co-evolution. However, radiative transfer effects in dense media may also impact the formation of hydrogen emission lines. We model three scattering processes shaping hydrogen line profiles: resonance scattering by hydrogen in the state, Raman scattering of ultraviolet (UV) radiation by ground-state hydrogen, and Thomson scattering by free electrons. Using 3D Monte Carlo radiative transfer simulations, we examine their imprint on line shapes and ratios. Resonance scattering produces strong deviations from Case B flux ratios, clear differences between H and H, and encodes gas kinematics in line profiles but cannot broaden H due to conversion to Pa. While Raman scattering can yield broad wings, scattering of the UV continuum is disfavoured given the absence of strong full width at half-maximum variations across transitions. Raman scattering of higher Lyman-series emission can produce H/H wing width ratios of , agreeing with observations. Thomson scattering can reproduce the observed wings under plausible conditions ─ e.g. K and ─ and lead to black hole mass overestimates by factors .

      "abstract": "{We revisit the spectral appearance of extended self-gravitating accretion disks around supermassive black holes. Using dust-poor opacity tables, we show that all optically thick disk solutions possess a universal outer effective temperature of $T\\_{\\rm eff}\\sim 4000-4500$K, closely resembling compact, high-redshift sources known as Little Red Dots (LRDs). Assuming the extended disk is primarily heated by stellar sources, this ``disk Hayashi limit'' fixes the dominant optical continuum temperature of the disk spectrum independent of accretion rate $\\dot{M}$, black hole mass $M\\_\\bullet$, and disk viscosity $α$, and removes the parameter-tuning required in previous disk interpretations of LRDs. We construct global self-gravitating accretion disk models with radially varying accretion rates, suggesting that burning of embedded stellar objects can both efficiently power the emission of the outer disk and hollow out the inner disk, strongly suppressing variable UV/X-ray associated with a standard quasar. The resulting disk emission is dominated by a luminous optical continuum while a separate, non-variable UV component arises from stellar populations on the nuclear to galaxy scale. We map the optimal region of parameter space for such systems and show that LRD-like appearances are guaranteed for $\\dot{M}/αrsim 0.1 M\\_\\odot /{\\rm yr}$, a threshold insensitive to $M\\_\\bullet$, below which the system may transition into classical non-self-gravitating AGN disks, potentially a later evolution stage. We expect this transition to be accompanied by the enhancement of metallicity and production of dust, giving rise to far infrared emission. This picture offers a physically motivated and quantitative framework connecting LRDs with AGNs and their associated nuclear stellar population.}",

We classify this object as a pseudo-LRD because its red rest-frame optical colour is mainly driven by a prominent Halpha line (with EW0 >\\raisebox{-0.5ex}\\textasciitilde 800 Angstroms) present in its JWST NIRSpec spectrum. Halpha is dominated by a narrow component and also has a minor broad component indicative of an active black hole with M\\_BH = 2.9x10\\^6 Msun.

However, no [OIII]5007 or any other metal lines are detected in the spectrum, so [OIII]5007/Hbeta < 0.25, at odds with a simple dust-attenuation explanation.

Due to their peculiar spectral properties and X-ray weakness, modeling LRDs with standard AGN templates has proven challenging. In particular, the validity of single-epoch virial mass estimates in determining the black hole (BH) masses of LRDs has been called into question, with some models claiming that masses might be overestimated by up to 2 orders of magnitude, and other models claiming that LRDs may be entirely stellar in nature. We report the direct, dynamical BH mass measurement in a strongly lensed LRD at $z = 7.04$. The combination of lensing with deep spectroscopic data reveals a rotation curve that is inconsistent with a nuclear star cluster, yet can be well explained by Keplerian rotation around a point mass of 50 million Solar masses, consistent with virial BH mass estimates from the Balmer lines. The Keplerian rotation leaves little room for any stellar component in a host galaxy, as we conservatively infer $M\\_{\\rm BH}/M\\_{*}>2$. Such a ``naked'' black hole, together with its near-pristine environment, indicates that this LRD is a massive black hole seed caught in its earliest accretion phase.}",

Concurrently, the rapid assembly of the first supermassive black holes (SMBHs) requires the formation of heavy seeds, for which supermassive stars (SMSs) are leading theoretical progenitors. In this work, we perform the first quantitative test of the hypothesis that LRDs are the direct observational manifestation of these primordial SMSs. We present a novel, first-principles pipeline generating synthetic spectra for a non-rotating, metal-free $10^6 \\, M\\_\\odot$ SMS. We establish that its luminosity ($L\\_λ\\approx 1.7 \\times 10^{44} \\, \\text{erg} \\, \\text{s}^{-1} \\, μ\\text{m}^{-1}$ at 4050 Angstroms) provides a decisive constraint, matching prominent LRDs. Our model self-consistently reproduces their defining spectral features: the extreme, V-shaped Balmer break is an intrinsic photospheric effect, while the complex line phenomenology, strong H$β$ in emission with other Balmer lines in absorption arises from non-LTE effects in a single stellar atmosphere. Applying physically motivated broadening, our spectrum provides an excellent quantitative match to LRDs at both high ($z=7.76$) and low ($z=3.55$) redshift. Our model provides a simple, self-consistent physical picture for LRDs, offering a compelling alternative to multi-component obscured AGN scenarios and suggesting we may be directly witnessing the final, luminous moments of an SMBH progenitor before its ultimate collapse.}",

      "abstract": "{Little Red Dots (LRDs) are a new class of compact extragalactic objects, with a v-shaped optical spectral energy distribution breaking close to the Balmer break wavelength, and broad, typically exponentially-shaped lines. They are believed to be supermassive black holes surrounded by very dense, ionized gas, leading us to explore for any departures from Case B recombination by examining the ratios of multiple hydrogen Balmer lines: $Hα$, $Hβ$, $Hγ$, and $Hδ$. We analyze a dozen high-S/N LRDs with JWST/NIRSpec, measuring Balmer ratios in the seven objects with coverage of at least three lines. We decompose the line ratios into their respective broad and narrow components. Broad line ratios are consistent with Case B plus dust extinction in all objects but one, RUBIES EGS-49140, which departs from Case B expectations by more than $5σ$. The narrow components are consistent with minimal dust attenuation, while two objects exhibit narrow $Hα$/$Hβ\\approx 1.8$. Such low decrements are observed in highly ionized density bounded nebulae, associated with starburst environments. Nevertheless, both flat decrement cases can be reconciled assuming an unresolved absorption feature. RUBIES EGS-49140, shows a high broad $Hα$/$Hβ$, but $Hγ$/$Hα$ and $Hδ$/$Hα$ ratios are lower than expected for extinction-modified Case B, hinting at an unphysically steep dust law. These line ratios may be due to increased optical depth in the Balmer lines, as a direct effect of high density (log$n\\_e$ > 9) gas surrounding the black hole. If Case B recombination does hold in most LRDs, they must be moderate-to- heavily dust obscured ($A\\_V\\simeq1-8$) while the host-galaxy should be dust-free, suggesting that the extinction in the broad lines is local to the LRD and not due to the general ISM of the host galaxy.}",

These 'Little Red Dots' (LRDs) have been explored through spectral and photometric studies, but their nature is still under debate. As part of the BlackTHUNDER survey, we have observed UNCOVER\\_20466, one of the most distant LRDs known (z = 8.5), with the JWST/NIRSpec IFU. Previous JWST/NIRCam and JWST/NIRSpec MSA observations of this source revealed its LRD nature, as well as the presence of an AGN. Using our NIRSpec IFU data, we confirm that UNCOVER\\_20466 is an LRD (based on spectral slopes and compactness) that contains an overmassive black hole. However, our observed Balmer decrements do not suggest strong dust attenuation, resulting in a lower -based bolometric luminosity and {\\ensuremath{\\lambda}}$\\_{Edd}$ () than previously found. This source lies on local relations between M$\\_{BH}$ - {\\ensuremath{\\sigma}}$\\_{*}$ and M$\\_{BH}$ - M$\\_{dyn}$, suggesting that this could be a progenitor of the core of a lower-redshift galaxy. We explore the possible evolution of this source, finding evidence for substantial black hole accretion in the past and a likely origin as a heavy seed at high redshift (\\raisebox{-0.5ex}\\textasciitilde{}10$^{3}$ M$\\_{{\\ensuremath{\\odot}}}$). emission is strongly detected, implying . The extremely high / ratio is indicative of not only AGN photoionization and heating, but also extremely high densities (), suggesting that this black hole at such high redshift may be forming in an ultra-dense protogalaxy.}",

      "abstract": "{Several local ($z\\lesssim 0.2$) metal-poor dwarf AGNs have remarkably similar properties to those of high-redshift Little Red Dots (LRDs), and are recently proposed to be local analogs of LRDs. We use long-term photometric and spectroscopic observations of three local LRDs spanning $\\sim 20$ years to measure variability in their rest-frame optical continuum and broad H$α$ emission lines. Using ZTF light curves over a rest-frame $\\sim 5$ yr baseline, the $r$-band intrinsic rms variability is $(9\\times 10^{-5})\\_{\\rm -9E-5}^{+0.014}$ mag (J1022), $0.025\\pm0.004$ mag (J1025) and $0.020\\pm0.005$ mag (J1047), indicating low intrinsic variability ($<3-4\\%$ at 3$σ$). These rms variability amplitudes are much lower than those for dwarf AGNs and more massive quasars. There is little structure in the optical variability structure functions for the three local LRDs, in contrast to normal AGN variability. Using available multi-epoch spectra, we constrain the broad H$α$ line flux variability to be less than a few percent, without significant profile changes, over a rest-frame baseline of $\\sim 15$ yrs in J1025 and J1047, respectively. The three LRDs stand out in the Balmer line properties compared with normal broad-line AGNs, with exceptionally large H$α$ equivalent widths and H$α$/H$β$ ratios far exceeding the Case B recombination value. In the context of recent theoretical models of LRDs as dense gas-enshrouded massive black holes with super-Eddington accretion, our results suggest that the photosphere emission is long-term stable and the broad Balmer lines are primarily collisonally excited. This scenario is consistent with the lack of variability, large H$α$/H$β$ ratios and little dust extinction, as well as the expected high gas density. Virial black hole mass estimates using broad H$α$ assuming photoionization are therefore highly questionable for LRDs.}",

      "abstract": "{Among the most puzzling early discoveries of JWST are ``little red dots'' (LRDs), compact red sources that host broad Balmer emission lines, and in many cases exhibit a ``V-shaped'' change in slope in the rest-optical. The physical properties of LRDs currently have order-of-magnitude uncertainties, because models to explain the continuum of these sources differ immensely. Here, we leverage the complete selection of red sources in the RUBIES program, supplemented with public PRISM spectra, to study the origin of this V shape. By fitting a broken power law with a flexible inflection point, we find that a large fraction of red H{\\ensuremath{\\alpha}} emitters at 2 < z < 6 exhibit a strong change in slope, and that all strong inflections appear associated with the Balmer limit (0.3645 {\\ensuremath{\\mu}}m). Using a simple model of a reddened active galactic nucleus (AGN) with an unobscured scattered-light component, we demonstrate that the observed V shape in LRDs is unlikely to occur at any specific wavelength if the entire continuum is dominated by light from a power-law AGN continuum. In contrast, models with an intrinsic feature at the Balmer limit, such as those that are dominated by an evolved stellar population, can produce the observed spectral shapes, provided that a reddened component picks up sufficiently redward of the break. While no model can comfortably explain the full LRD spectral energy distribution, the common inflection location suggests that a single component consistently dominates the rest-frame UV optical in LRDs, and that this component is associated with T {\\ensuremath{\\sim}} {}10$^{4}$ K hydrogen.}",

      "abstract": "{The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has revealed a population of red and compact sources at z {\\ensuremath{\\gtrsim}} 5 known as ``little red dots'' (LRDs) that are likely active galactic nuclei (AGNs). Here, we present a comprehensive study of the variability of 314 LRDs with multi-epoch JWST observations in five deep fields: Ultra Deep Survey, GOODS-S, GOODS-N, A2744, and COSMOS. Our analyses use all publicly available JWST NIRCam imaging data in these fields, together with multi-epoch JWST MIRI images available. We measure the significance (signal-to- noise ratio or SNR$\\_{var}$) of the variabilities for all LRDs and statistically evaluate their variabilities using the SNR$\\_{var}$ distributions. We pay particular attention to the systematic offsets of photometric zero-points among different epochs that seem to commonly exist. The derived SNR$\\_{var}$ distributions of the LRDs, including those with broad H{\\ensuremath{\\alpha}}/H{\\ensuremath{\\beta}} emission lines, follow the standard Gaussian distribution, and are generally consistent with those of the comparison samples of objects detected in the same images. This finding suggests that the LRD population, on average, does not show strong variability, which can be explained by super-Eddington accretion of the black holes in AGNs. Alternatively, many of them may be dominated by galaxies. We also find eight strongly variable LRD candidates with variability amplitudes of 0.24{\\textendash}0.82 mag. The rest-frame optical spectral energy distributions of these variable LRDs should have a significant AGN contribution. Future JWST observations will provide more variability information on LRDs.}",

If physically associated with the LRD, this component may trace stellar emission from an off- center host galaxy, neighboring companions, or nebular gas illuminated by the active nucleus. We investigate the detailed spectral energy distribution (SED) of the extended emission near four LRDs in the JWST UNCOVER and MegaScience surveys. We accurately decompose the extended emission from the dominant point source by simultaneously fitting the images in eight broadband and nine medium-band filters. After considering both the results from photometric redshift fitting and the probability of galaxies at different redshifts overlapping, we confirm that the off-center blobs in three sources are physically associated with the LRDs, with two of them showing strong [O III] {\\ensuremath{\\lambda}}{\\ensuremath{\\lambda}}4959, 5007 emission captured by the medium-band filters. While the SEDs of all three blobs can be modeled assuming star-forming galaxies with stellar mass {\\ensuremath{\\sim}}{}10$^{8}$ M$\\_{{\\ensuremath{\\odot}}}$, the exceptionally strong [O III] emission of two sources is best interpreted as pure nebular emission from low-density (n < 10 cm$^{‑3}$), low-metallicity (Z {\\ensuremath{\\approx}} 0.05‑1 Z$\\_{{\\ensuremath{\\odot}}}$) gas photoionized by the ultraviolet radiation from the nearby LRD. Adopting LRD halo masses constrained by clustering measurements and theoretical considerations, we estimate a typical baryonic halo mass accretion rate of {\\ensuremath{\\sim}}2‑9 M$\\_{{\\ensuremath{\\odot}}}$ yr$^{‑1}$. If the halo accretion rate is sustained to z = 4 and stars form with an efficiency of 10\\%, the accreted gas would build a galaxy with stellar mass {\\ensuremath{\\sim}}{}10$^{9}$ M$\\_{{\\ensuremath{\\odot}}}$, potentially rendering them spatially resolved at lower redshift.}",

Photometric samples were constructed from varying selection criteria with limited spectroscopic follow-up available to test intrinsic spectral shapes and the prevalence of broad emission lines. We used the RUBIES survey, a large spectroscopic program with wide color-morphology coverage and homogeneous data quality, to systematically analyze the emission-line kinematics, spectral shapes, and morphologies of {\\ensuremath{\\sim}}1500 galaxies at z > 3.1. We identified broad Balmer lines via a novel fitting approach that simultaneously models NIRSpec/PRISM and G395M spectra, yielding 80 broad-line sources with 28 (35\\%) at z > 6. A large subpopulation naturally emerged from the broad Balmer line sources, with 36 exhibiting v-shaped UV-to-optical continua and a dominant point source component in the rest-optical; we define these as spectroscopic LRDs, constituting the largest such sample to date. Strikingly, the spectroscopic LRD population is largely recovered when either a broad line or rest-optical point source is required in combination with a v-shaped continuum, suggesting an inherent link between these three defining characteristics. We compared the spectroscopic LRD sample to published photometric searches. Although these selections have high accuracy, 80\\%‑95\\% down to F444W < 26.5, only 50\\%‑80\\% of the RUBIES LRDs were photometrically identified, depending on the selection criteria used. The remainder were missed due to a mixture of faint rest-UV photometry, comparatively blue rest-optical colors, or highly uncertain photometric redshifts.

Since LRDs may be in the early phase of black hole growth, identifying them in the early Universe is crucial for understanding the formation of the first supermassive black holes.

In this study, we present the first search for z {\\ensuremath{\\gtrsim}} 10 LRD candidates using both NIRCam and MIRI imaging from COSMOS-Web, which provides the largest joint NIRCam-MIRI coverage to date (0.20 deg$^{2}$).

      "abstract": "{Cold, substellar objects such as brown dwarfs have long been recognized as contaminants in color-selected samples of active galactic nuclei (AGNs). In particular, their near- to mid-infrared colors (1-5 {\\ensuremath{\\mu}}m) can closely resemble the V-shaped (f $\\_{ {\\ensuremath{\\lambda}} }$) spectra of highly reddened accreting supermassive black holes (``little red dots''), especially at 6 < z < 7. Recently, a NIRCam-selected sample of little red dots over 45 arcmin$^{2}$ has been followed up with deep NIRSpec multiobject prism spectroscopy through the UNCOVER program. By investigating the acquired spectra, we identify 3 of the 14 followed-up objects as T/Y dwarfs with temperatures between 650 and 1300 K and distances between 0.8 and 4.8 kpc. At ${4.8}\\_{-0.1}^{+0.6}$ kpc, A2744-BD1 is the most distant brown dwarf discovered to date. We identify the remaining 11 objects as extragalactic sources at z $\\_{spec}$ {\\ensuremath{\\gtrsim}} 5. Given that three of these sources are strongly lensed images of the same AGN (A2744-QSO1), we derive a brown dwarf contamination fraction of 25\\% in this NIRCam selection of little red dots.

The observations are part of the JWST Cycle-3 treasury program, Slitless Areal Pure-Parallel HIgh-Redshift Emission Survey (SAPPHIRES) with NIRCam-grism. Using wide field slitless spectroscopy (WFSS) obtained in the MACS0416 parallel field, we robustly confirm nine galaxies at $z\\_{\\rm spec}\\sim8.47$ via emission line detections of [OIII]5008A (with $>5\\,\\sigma$) and tentatively confirm one additional galaxy (at $\\sim3\\,\\sigma$). This discovery represents the highest-redshift, spectroscopically confirmed galaxy over-density known to date, which is $\\sim6$--$8$ times more dense than the average volume density of galaxies at the same redshift. Furthermore, a galaxy hosting a low-mass active galactic nucleus (``Little-Red-Dot'') is found as a member, suggesting an early emergence of active, massive black holes and feedback between these black holes and their surrounding environments. We also discuss the spatial structures connecting the galaxy over-density to nearby massive star- forming galaxies (separated by $\\sim 5$pMpc, including MACS0416-Y1 and MACS0416-JD. This finding of a massive dark matter halo hosting a galaxy over-density at $z\\sim8.5$ is surprising given that our survey covered only a small, random field ($16.5\\,{\\rm arcmin^2}$) as part of a pure parallel observation. The comparison with cosmological simulations shows that the likelihood of finding such a large-scale structure is $<5\\,\\%$ under the current galaxy formation scenario and the observed survey volume. Our results demonstrate the power of WFSS observations to build a complete line-emitter sample and suggest an important role for over-densities in enhancing galaxy formation by funneling large-scale gas supplies into small cosmological volumes.}",

      "abstract": "{The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) observations have revolutionized extragalactic research, particularly with the discovery of little red dots (LRDs), which have been discovered as a population of dust-reddened broad-line active galactic nuclei (AGNs). Their unique V-shaped spectral feature, characterized by a red optical continuum and a UV excess in the rest frame, challenges us to discern the relative contributions of the galaxy and AGN. We study a spectral energy distribution (SED) model for LRDs from rest-frame UV to infrared bands. We hypothesize that the incident radiation from an AGN, characterized by a typical SED, is embedded in an extended dusty medium with an extinction law similar to those seen in dense regions such as Orion Nebula or certain AGN environments. The UV‑optical spectrum is described by dust-attenuated AGN emission, featuring a red optical continuum at {\\ensuremath{\\lambda}} > 4000 {\\r{A}} and a flat UV spectral shape established through a gray extinction curve at {\\ensuremath{\\lambda}} < 3000 {\\r{A}}, due to the absence of small-size grains. There is no need for additional stellar emission or AGN scattered light. In the infrared, the SED is shaped by an extended dust and gas distribution ({\\ensuremath{\\gamma}} < 1; {\\ensuremath{\\rho}} {\\ensuremath{\\propto}} r$^{‑{\\ensuremath{\\gamma}}}$) with characteristic gas densities of ≃10{\\textendash}{}10$^{3}$ cm$^{‑3}$, which allows relatively cool dust temperatures to dominate the radiation. As a result, these dust structures shift the emission energy peak from near-infrared to mid-infrared bands in the rest frame; for sources at z \\raisebox{-0.5ex}\\textasciitilde 4{\\textendash}7, the corresponding wavelengths shift from the JWST/MIRI to Herschel range. This model, unlike the typical AGN hot torus models, can produce an infrared SED flattening that is consistent with LRD observations through JWST MIRI. Such a density structure can arise from the coexistence of inflows and outflows during the early assembly of galactic nuclei. This might be the reason why LRDs emerge preferentially in the high-redshift Universe younger than 1 billion years.}",

      "abstract": "{Since the launch of James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) in late 2021, our understanding of high-redshift objects has faced several upheavals. JWST has discovered much more massive galaxies and supermassive black holes (SMBH) than cosmological models had expected. Furthermore, JWST observations have revealed an entirely novel population of high-redshift objects. Characterized by a dominant red rest-frame component and point- like morphology, these ``little red dots'' (LRD) have set off a flurry of observational and theoretical follow-up. The current identity of LRD is highly debated, yet falling into two main scenarios: active galactic nuclei (i.e., SMBH) or compact star- forming regions. If star-forming, LRD would represent the highest stellar densities ever observed. If SMBH, their high Eddington fractions, and already high masses, help elucidate the growth of the most massive SMBH found by JWST in the early Universe ($z rsim4)$. In this mini-review, we present the observational evidence accumulated to date, including sub- millimeter probes of LRD dust masses, constraints on radio and X-ray emission from stacking, and rest-frame ultraviolet optical measurements provided by JWST. Furthermore, we highlight how identifying additional LRD that are truly primarily SMBH- driven may help to shed light on the formation of `overly massive' SMBH discovered by JWST within the first billion years since the Big Bang.}",

      "abstract": "{Little red dots (LRDs), high-redshift, compact, red objects with V-shaped spectra, are one of the most exciting and perplexing discoveries made by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). While the simplest explanation for LRDs is that they are high-redshift active galactic nuclei (AGN), due to their compactness and frequent association with broad-line emission, the lack of corresponding X-ray emission and observed variability casts doubt on this picture. Here, we simulate LRD light curves using both traditional models for sub-Eddington AGN variability derived empirically from lower-redshift AGN observations and moderately super-Eddington AGN disk models from radiation magnetohydrodynamic simulations to examine the reason for the lack of variability. We find that even though most LRDs have only been observed two to four times in a given wave band, we should still be detecting significantly more variability if traditional sub-Eddington AGN variability models can be applied to LRDs. Instead, our super-Eddington model light curves are consistent with the lack of observed LRD variability. In addition, the ongoing high-cadence NEXUS campaign will detect changes in magnitude {\\ensuremath{\\Delta}}m > 1 for traditional sub-Eddington models, but will only observe significant continuum variability for the lowest-mass LRDs for our super- Eddington AGN models. Even if LRDs lack continuum variability, we find that the ongoing spectroscopic JWST campaign TWINKLE should observe broad emission line variability as long as soft X-ray irradiation manages to reach the broad-line region from the inner disk. Our models show that super-Eddington accretion can easily explain the lack of continuum variability in LRDs.}",

Perhaps the most surprising features of this population are the presence of Balmer absorption and ubiquitous strong Balmer breaks. Recent models link these features to an active supermassive black hole (SMBH) cocooned in very dense gas (N$\\_{H}$ {\\ensuremath{\\sim}} {}10$^{24}$ cm$^{{\\ensuremath{-}}2}$). We present a stringent test of such models using VLT/MUSE observations of A2744-45924, the most luminous LRD known to date (L$\\_{H{\\ensuremath{\\alpha}}}$ ≍ {}10$^{44}$ erg s$^{{\\ensuremath{-}}1}$), located behind the Abell-2744 lensing cluster at z = 4.464 ({\\ensuremath{\\mu}} = 1.8).

In the environment of A2744-45924, we identified four extended Ly{\\ensuremath{\\alpha}} halos ({\\ensuremath{\\Delta}}z < 0.02, {\\ensuremath{\\Delta}}r < 100 pkpc).

The dynamics of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) is modelled from seeding down to their coalescence at sub-parsec scales due to gravitational wave (GW) emission by utilising a new version of the KETJU code, which combines regularised integration of sufficiently massive SMBHs with a dynamical friction subgrid model for lower-mass SMBHs. All nine massive galaxies included in this study go through a gas-dominated phase of early compaction in the redshift range of $z\\sim 7-9$, starting at stellar masses of $M\\_\\starrsim 10^8\\ \\mathrm{M}\\_\\odot$ and ending at a few times $M\\_{\\star}\\sim 10^9\\ \\mathrm{M}\\_\\odot$. The sizes, masses and broad band fluxes of these compact systems are in general agreement with the population of systems observed with JWST known as `Little Red Dots'. In the compact phase, the stellar and SMBH masses grow rapidly, leading to a sharp decline in the central gas fractions. The outer regions, however, remain relatively gas- rich, leading to subsequent off-centre star formation and size growth. Due to the very high central stellar densities ($ρ\\_{\\star}rsim 10^{13}\\,\\mathrm{M\\_\\odot/kpc^3}$), the SMBHs merge rapidly, typically just $\\sim 4-35\\ \\mathrm{Myr}$ after the SMBH binaries have become bound.

      "abstract": "{We demonstrate that gas disks around binary systems might deliver gas to the binary components only when the circumbinary disk is relatively warm. We present new grid-based hydrodynamics simulations, performed with the binary on the grid and a locally isothermal equation of state, in which the binary is seen to functionally ``stop accreting'' if the orbital Mach number in the disk exceeds a threshold value of about 40. Above this threshold, the disk continues to extract angular momentum from the binary orbit, but it delivers very little mass to the black holes and instead piles up mass in a ring surrounding the binary. This ring will eventually become viscously relaxed and deliver mass to the binary at the large-scale inflow rate. However, we show that the timescale for such relaxation can far exceed the implied binary lifetime. We demonstrate that the ability of a binary{\\textendash}disk system to equilibrate is dependent on the efficiency at which accretion streams deposit mass onto the binary, which, in turn is highly sensitive to the thermodynamic conditions of the inner disk. If disks around massive black hole binaries do operate in such nonaccreting regimes, it suggests these systems may be dimmer than their single black hole counterparts but could exhibit dramatic rebrightening after the black holes inspiral and merge. This dimming begins in the UV/optical and could completely choke high-energy emission, such that these systems would likely be intrinsically X-ray weak with reddened continua, potentially resembling the spectra of ``little red dots'' recently identified in JWST observations.}",

      "abstract": "{JWST's ``Little Red Dots'' (LRDs) are increasingly interpreted as active galactic nuclei (AGN) obscured by dense thermalized gas rather than dust as evidenced by their X-ray weakness, blackbody-like continua, and Balmer line profiles. A key question is how LRDs connect to standard UV-luminous AGN and whether transitional phases exist and if they are observable. We present the ``X-Ray Dot'' (XRD), a compact source at $z=3.28$ observed by the NIRSpec WIDE GTO survey. The XRD exhibits LRD hallmarks: a blackbody-like ($T\\_{\\rm eff} \\simeq 6400\\,$K) red continuum, a faint but blue rest-UV excess, falling mid-IR emission, and broad Balmer lines ($\\rm FWHM \\sim 2700-3200\\,km\\,s^{-1}$). Unlike LRDs, however, it is remarkably X-ray luminous ($L\\_\\textrm{2$-$10$\\textbackslash,$keV} = 10^{44.18}\\,$erg$\\,$s$^{-1}$) and has a continuum inflection that is bluewards of the Balmer limit. We find that the red rest-optical and blue mid-IR continuum cannot be reproduced by standard dust-attenuated AGN models without invoking extremely steep extinction curves, nor can the weak mid-IR emission be reconciled with well-established X-ray--torus scaling relations. We therefore consider an alternative scenario: the XRD may be an LRD in transition, where the gas envelope dominates the optical continuum but optically thin sightlines allow X-rays to escape. The XRD may thus provide a physical link between LRDs and standard AGN, offering direct evidence that LRDs are powered by supermassive black holes and providing insight into their accretion properties.}",

      "abstract": "{We present a luminous Little Red Dot (LRD) at $z=6.027$, doubly imaged by the galaxy cluster Abell 383 and observed with JWST/NIRCam. The source shows the characteristic ``V-shaped'' SED and pronounced Balmer break that define the LRD population. Owing to its large magnifications, $μ\\sim11$ for image S1 and $μ\\sim7$ for S2, the system is exceptionally bright and highly stretched, providing a rare, spatially resolved view of an LRD. The images reveal a complex morphology with a compact red dot, a spatially offset blue dot, and faint emission bridging and surrounding the two. After correcting for lensing, we find that both dots are extremely small but resolved, with rest-frame UV sizes of $\\sim 20$ pc (red) and $\\sim60$ pc (blue). These compact dots are embedded in a more extended, line-dominated cloud traced most clearly in F356W ([OIII]+H$β$), which reaches scales of order $\\sim$1 kpc. SED decomposition shows that the blue component has a flat UV continuum consistent with a young stellar population, whereas the red component has a steep red SED that can be interpreted as either an evolved stellar population with high stellar mass ($\\log M\\_\\star/M\\_\\odot>10$) or a reddened AGN. If this object is representative of the LRD population, our results imply that the V-shaped SEDs of LRDs do not arise from individual compact sources but instead from the superposition of two physically distinct components. Separated by only $\\sim300$ pc in the source plane, these components would blend into a single compact source in unlensed observations with the canonical LRD colors. This system therefore provides a rare opportunity to resolve the internal structure of an LRD and to gain direct insight into the physical nature of this population.}",

The little red dots (LRDs), detected by several surveys at z > 4, present a significant interpretational challenge, as their spectral energy distributions (SEDs) can mimic both active galactic nucleus (AGN) and stellar population templates. This study analyzes 19 LRDs from the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey survey, utilizing NIRCam and MIRI photometry. By performing SED fitting across a vast parameter space, we explore a broad range of AGN fractions, defined as the ratio of the monochromatic luminosities (AGN, galaxy, and dust) over a specified wavelength range, 0.4{\\textendash}0.7 {\\ensuremath{\\mu}}m rest frame. We find that 17 of the 19 LRDs investigated are consistent with having significant AGN contributions, with best-fitting AGN fractions ranging between 20\\% and 70\\%, while one galaxy shows a low AGN contribution (2\\%) and another appears to be purely star forming. Moreover, assuming these LRDs do indeed host AGN, we can place limits on their black hole masses using the inferred AGN bolometric luminosities and adopting the Eddington limit. We find that, independent of the specific AGN fraction adopted, the LRDs' black holes are significantly overmassive relative to their host galaxies{\\textemdash}by {\\ensuremath{\\sim}}1 dex, and up to {\\ensuremath{\\sim}}4 dex in the most extreme cases{\\textemdash}compared to the local M$\\_{{\\textbullet}}${\\textendash}M$\\_{{\\ensuremath{\\star}}}$ relation.

      "abstract": "{The discovery of Little Red Dots (LRDs){\\textemdash}a population of compact, high-redshift, dust-reddened galaxies{\\textemdash}is one of the most surprising results from JWST. However, the nature of LRDs is still debated: does the near-infrared emission originate from accreting supermassive black holes (SMBHs), or intense star formation? In this work, we utilize ultra-deep Chandra observations and study LRDs residing behind the lensing galaxy cluster, A2744. We probe the X-ray emission from individual galaxies but find that they remain undetected and provide SMBH mass upper limits of {\\ensuremath{\\lesssim}}(1.5{\\textendash}16) {\\texttimes} {}10$^{6}$ M $\\_{{\\ensuremath{\\odot}}}$ assuming Eddington limited accretion. To increase the signal-to-noise ratios, we conduct a stacking analysis of the full sample with a total lensed exposure time of {\\ensuremath{\\approx}}87 Ms. We also bin the galaxies based on their stellar mass, lensing magnification, and detected broad-line H{\\ensuremath{\\alpha}} emission. For the LRDs exhibiting broad-line H{\\ensuremath{\\alpha}} emission, there is a hint of a stacked signal ({\\ensuremath{\\sim}}2.6{\\ensuremath{\\sigma}}), corresponding to an SMBH mass of {\\ensuremath{\\sim}}3.2 {\\texttimes} {}10$^{6}$ M $\\_{{\\ensuremath{\\odot}}}$. Assuming unobscured, Eddington- limited accretion, this black hole (BH) mass is at least 1.5 orders of magnitude lower than that inferred from virial mass estimates using JWST spectra. Given galaxy-dominated stellar mass estimates, our results imply that LRDs do not host overmassive SMBHs and/or accrete at a few percent of their Eddington limit. However, alternative stellar mass estimates may still support that LRDs host overmassive BHs. The significant discrepancy between the JWST and Chandra data hints that the scaling relations used to infer the SMBH mass from the H{\\ensuremath{\\alpha}} line and virial relations may not be applicable for high-redshift LRDs.}",

Among the 99 selected LRDs, we examine the morphology of 30. The remaining 69 appear predominantly compact, with sizes {\\ensuremath{\\lesssim}}400 pc and no extended components even in stacked SW images. However, their unresolved nature may partly reflect current depth limitations, which could prevent the detection of faint diffuse components. Among the 30 morphologically analyzed LRDs, 50\\% show multiple associated components, while the rest exhibit highly asymmetric structures, despite appearing as single sources. This diversity in rest- frame UV morphologies may point to interactions or strong internal feedback. We find median stellar masses of log10(M{\\ens uremath{\\star}}/M{\\ensuremath{\\odot}})=9.07‑0.08+0.11 for pure stellar models with AV{\\ensuremath{\\approx}}1.16‑0.21+0.11 mag, and log10(M{\\ensuremath{\\star}}/M{\\ensuremath{\\odot}})=9.67‑0.27 +0.17 for models including active galactic nuclei (AGNs) with AV{\\ensuremath{\\approx}}2.74‑0.71+0.55 mag, in line with recent studies suggesting higher masses and dust content for AGN-fitted LRDs.

      "abstract": "{JWST has identified a large population of faint, broad-line active galactic nuclei (AGN) in the early universe that are powered by black holes (BHs) that often appear overmassive relative to their host galaxies. In this study, we examine the relationship between BH mass and galaxy stellar mass at $3<z<7$ using a sample of 70 broad-line AGN identified using NIRSpec/G395M spectroscopy from the CEERS, JADES, and RUBIES surveys. Roughly half (43\\textbackslash\\%) of our sample appear heavily reddened and are classified as little red dots (LRDs). We estimate BH masses ($M\\_{\\rm BH}$) using single-epoch virial techniques, while host stellar masses ($M\\_{\\star}$) are inferred using a combination of two-dimensional surface brightness profile fitting and spectral energy distribution modeling. We find that a majority of our sources (50/70) have $M\\_{\\rm BH}/M\\_{\\star}$ ratios that are 1-2 dex higher than that observed in AGN locally. Using a forward-modeling Bayesian framework that accounts for uncertainties, intrinsic scatter, and selection effects, we infer a $M\\_{\\rm BH}-M\\_{\\star}$ relationship that is $>3σ$ above the relationship measured for local broad-line AGN. We derive an intrinsic scatter in this relationship of $0.9$ dex, which does not vary over the redshift range of our sample. We also find that the $M\\_{\\rm BH}/M\\_{\\star}$ ratio increases by $2.3$ dex from $z = 3.5$ and $z = 6.5$ with a confidence level of $ > 3σ$. We attribute this trend with the increasing fraction of LRDs in our sample at $z>4$ as their host masses are $\\sim1$ dex lower than the non-LRD AGN in our sample. These results support a picture in which the BHs powering JWST's broad-line AGN are genuinely overmassive and become increasingly so with redshift. We discuss the implications of our findings on early BH growth relative to that of their host galaxies and the constraints it places on BH seeding models.}",

The detection of strong Fe II, O I, and Ca II triplet emission lines, along with the evidence of broad Balmer lines, provides strong evidence of a broad-line region (BLR) and an accreting supermassive black hole. Notably, we report the first detection of the {\\ensuremath{\\lambda}}1304 bump (i.e., a blend of O I {\\ensuremath{\\lambda}}1304 and Si II) at high redshift, a feature commonly seen in local AGNs but not yet reported in the early Universe. The O I {\\ensuremath{\\lambda}}1304/{\\ensuremath{\\lambda}}8446 photon ratio provides an independent measurement of dust attenuation in galaxies.

High O I {\\ensuremath{\\lambda}}8446 equivalent width and weak O I {\\ensuremath{\\lambda}}7774 support this interpretation. The detection of iron emission, whether from broad permitted or narrow forbidden lines, supports the presence of a stratified BLR, as also recently proposed in local LRDs.

      "abstract": "{One of the most puzzling discoveries by JWST is the population of high- redshift, red, and compact galaxies dubbed little red dots (LRDs). Based on broad-line diagnostics, these galaxies have been argued to host accreting {}10$^{7}${\\textendash}{}10$^{8}$ M$\\_{{\\ensuremath{\\odot}}}$ supermassive black holes (SMBHs), a claim with crucial consequences for our understanding of how the first black holes form and grow over cosmic time. A key feature of LRDs is their extreme X-ray weakness: analyses of individual and stacked sources have yielded nondetections or only tentative, inconclusive X-ray signals, except for a handful of individual cases. Although high obscuration is the most straightforward way to explain the X-ray weakness of LRDs, JWST rest-frame optical/UV spectra initially argued against the presence of Compton-thick gas clouds. Instead, several authors have proposed that LRDs are intrinsically X-ray weak due to super-Eddington accretion rates. In this work, we observationally test these tailored models by stacking X-ray data for 55 LRDs in the Chandra Deep Field South, accumulating a total exposure time of nearly 400 Ms. Despite reaching unprecedented X-ray depths, our stack still yields a nondetection. The corresponding upper limits are deep enough to rule out current super-Eddington accretion models and are compatible only with extremely high levels of obscuration (N$\\_{H}$ {\\ensuremath{\\gtrsim}} {}10$^{25}$ cm$^{‑2}$). To explain the X-ray weakness of LRDs, we therefore speculate that the SMBHs in these systems are neither as massive nor as luminous as currently believed.}",

Red Eyes are spatially resolved on the image plane with distinct colors, while the critical curve lies far north of Red Eyes, clearly requiring two different LRDs rather than a single LRD. Red Eyes is an extremely close pair of LRDs separated by $\\sim70\\,\\mathrm{pc}$ in the source plane with a magnification of $μ\\sim20$, which consistently explains another counter-image detected to the north-west. Red Eyes is hosted in a typical star-forming galaxy with $M\\_{\\mathrm{UV,int}}\\sim -19$, but its own UV emission is very faint ($M\\_{\\mathrm{UV,int}} rsim -16$). Moreover, Red Eyes does not reside at the galaxy center but lies at an offset position of approximately one effective radius $R\\_{\\mathrm{e}}$ away from the galaxy center. If observed without lensing, Red Eyes would appear as a typical star-forming galaxy at $z\\sim 7$ with $M\\_{\\mathrm{UV}}\\sim -19$, showing no apparent LRD signatures in either morphology or SED. These results suggest that multiple off-center LRDs, similar to Red Eyes, may be commonly hidden in a typical high-$z$ star-forming galaxy.

We show that even under very conservative assumptions almost all growth of SMBH mass at z>6 does not take place in these UV- luminous quasars, but must occur in systems obscured through dust and/or with lower radiative efficiency than standard thin accretion disks. The 'Soltan argument' is not fulfilled by the known population of bright quasars at z>6: the integrated SMBH mass growth inferred from these largely unobscured active galactic nuclei (AGN) in the early Universe is by a factor $$10 smaller than the total SMBH mass volume density at z=6. This is valid under a large range of assumption about luminosity, mass functions, and accretion modes, and is likely still a factor >2 smaller when accounting for known obscuration fractions at this epoch. The resulting consequences are: >90\\%, possibly substantially more, of SMBH-buildup in the early Universe does not take place in luminous unobscured quasar phases, but has to occur in obscured systems, with dust absorbing most of the emitted UV-visible AGN emission, potentially with accretion modes with super-Eddington specific accretion rates. This is consistent with short lifetimes for luminous quasar phases from quasar proximity zone studies and clustering. This would remove the empirical need for slow SMBH growth and hence exotic 'high- mass seed' black holes at early cosmic time.

As a subsample of these sources, commonly called ``little red dots'' (LRDs), have been spectroscopically observed to host a broad- line active galactic nucleus (AGN), they have been the focus of multiple recent studies in an attempt to understand the origin of their UV and optical emission. Here, we assemble a sample of 123 LRDs from the literature along with spectroscopic and photometric JWST-identified samples of AGNs to compare their colors and spectral slopes. We find that while obscured AGNs at z < 6 have highly dissimilar colors to LRDs, unobscured AGNs at z < 6 span a wide range of colors, with only a subsample showing colors similar to LRDs. At z > 6, the majority of the unobscured AGNs that have been found in these samples are LRDs, but this may be related to the fact that these sources are at large bolometric luminosities. Because LRDs occupy a unique position in galaxy color space, they are more straightforward to target, and the large number of broad-line AGNs that do not have LRD colors and slopes are therefore underrepresented in many spectroscopic surveys because they are more difficult to preselect. Current LRD selection techniques return a large and disparate population, including many sources having 2{\\textendash}5 {\\ensuremath{\\mu}}m colors impacted by emission- line flux boosting in individual filters.}",

      "abstract": "{One of the most mysterious results from observations of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is the detection of numerous, high- redshift, very red, extremely compact, broad-line sources termed ``little red dots'' (LRDs). It is unclear whether the LRDs belong to an active galactic nucleus (AGN) or simply a collection of very compact star clusters. We build spectral energy distributions (SEDs) for 29 LRDs at $z \\approx 3-8.5$ based on JWST photometric and spectroscopic observations. We find that the V-shaped SEDs of these LRDs exhibit a roughly similar break frequency at $ν\\_{\\rm b}=10^{14.96\\pm0.06}$ Hz, which corresponds to $λ\\_{\\rm b}=3287\\_{-424}^{+487} \\textÅ$ in the rest frame. We propose that this unique SED can be explained by the combination of an inner standard disk and an outer gravitationally unstable accretion disk with Toomre parameter $Q\\sim1$. The outer disk has a temperature of $\\sim2000-4000$ K for typical AGN parameters, which can well reproduce the near- infrared to optical bump as observed in LRDs. This model can naturally explain the strong infrared to optical emission and the V-shaped SED with a similar break frequency $\\simeq 10^{15}$ Hz for LRDs without invoking strong dust extinction or unusual stellar contribution from a host galaxy. Most LRDs stay in sub- Eddington state based on the SED modeling, which are intrinsically weak in X-rays.}",

We model LRDs as super-massive stars (SMSs) surrounded by massive self- gravitating accretion discs (SMDs) that form as a consequence of gas-rich major galaxy mergers. The model provides an excellent match for numerous spectral features of LRDs, where the V-shape arises from the superposition of two black bodies, and Balmer line broadening is sourced by the intrinsic rotation of the SMD. No additional AGN, stellar wind, dust obscuration or galactic component is required. This results in a model with uniquely few, physically motivated free parameters that are robust to variations in observed LRD properties. We perform MCMC fits for two representative LRD spectra, for which the full parameter posterior distributions are determined. Allowing for a compressed SMS mass-radius relation, the recovered parameters are compatible with sub-Eddington accretion in self-gravitating discs, and the recovered SMS masses of few $ 10^6$ M$\\_{\\odot}$ imply the subsequent formation of massive black holes (BH) that squarely follow the expected BH mass--galaxy mass relation.

Spectroscopic identifications reported that most LRDs are active galactic nuclei (AGNs), which are preferentially found around z\\raisebox{-0.5ex}\\textasciitilde6 and could imply a key phase in the formation and growth of black holes (BHs) in the early universe. Photometric surveys at lower redshift have recently been carried out to trace their evolution across cosmic time, and a small number of LRDs have been spectroscopically identified at both Cosmic Noon and in the local universe. Here we report the discovery of one of the lowest-z analogs of LRDs, J204837.26-002437.2 (hereafter J2048) at z = 0.4332, using new Gemini-N/GMOS IFU observations combined with archival multi-band photometric SED data. The GMOS data reveal extended blue emission from starburst with a star formation rate of 400 Msun yr-1, together with an extended, highly fast ionized outflow. This is the first spectroscopic confirmation of extended host emission and outflow in an LRD- like galaxy, providing a unique laboratory for understanding the nature of their high-redshift counterparts. Moreover, J2048 would host an extremely overmassive BH with a BH-to-stellar mass ratio of 0.6, with the BH mass and host stellar mass estimated to be 10\\^10.2 and 10\\^10.4 Msun, respectively. We discuss the origin and evolutionary fate of J2048, and the implications that such low-z analogs have for interpreting the properties of high-z LRDs.}",

      "abstract": "{The recent discovery of a large number of massive black holes within the first two billion years after the Big Bang, as well as their peculiar properties, have been largely unexpected based on the extrapolation of the properties of luminous quasars. These findings have prompted the development of several theoretical models for the early formation and growth of black holes, which are, however, difficult to differentiate. We report the metallicity measurement around a gravitationally lensed massive black hole at redshift 7.04 (classified as a Little Red Dot), hosted in a galaxy with very low dynamical mass. The weakness of the [OIII]5007 emission line relative to the narrow H$β$ emission indicates extremely low metallicity, about $4\\times 10^{-3}$ solar, and even more metal poor in the surrounding few 100 pc. We argue that such properties cannot be uncommon among accreting black holes around this early cosmic epoch. Explaining such a low chemical enrichment in a system that has developed a massive black hole is challenging for most theories. Models assuming heavy black hole seeds (such as Direct Collapse Black Holes) or super-Eddington accretion scenarios struggle to explain the observations, although they can potentially reproduce the observed properties in some cases. Models invoking ``primordial black holes'' (i.e. putative black holes formed shortly after the Big Bang) may potentially explain the low chemical enrichment associated with this black hole, although this class of models also requires further developments for proper testing.}",

      "abstract": "{JWST has revealed a population of low-luminosity active galactic nuclei at z > 4 in compact, red hosts (the ``Little Red Dots,'' or LRDs), which are largely undetected in X-rays. We investigate this phenomenon using General Relativistic Radiation Magnetohydrodynamics simulations of super-Eddington accretion onto a supermassive black hole (SMBH) with M $\\_{{\\textbullet}}$ = {}10$^{7}$ M $\\_{{\\ensuremath{\\odot}}}$ at z {\\ensuremath{\\sim}} 6, representing the median population; the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) that we obtain are intrinsically X-ray weak. The highest levels of X-ray weakness occur in SMBHs accreting at mildly super-Eddington rates (1.4 < f $\\_{Edd}$ < 4) with zero spin, viewed at angles >30{\\textdegree} from the pole. X-ray bolometric corrections in the observed 2{\\textendash}10 keV band reach {\\ensuremath{\\sim}}{}10$^{4}$ at z = 6, {\\ensuremath{\\sim}}5 times higher than the highest constraint from X-ray stacking. Most SEDs are extraordinarily steep and soft in the X-rays (median photon index {\\ensuremath{\\Gamma}} = 3.1, mode of {\\ensuremath{\\Gamma}} = 4.4). SEDs strong in the X-rays have harder spectra with a high-energy bump when viewed near the hot (>{}10$^{8}$ K) and highly relativistic jet, whereas X-ray weak SEDs lack this feature. Viewing an SMBH within 10{\\textdegree} of its pole, where beaming enhances the X-ray emission, has a {\\ensuremath{\\sim}}1.5\\% probability, matching the LRD X-ray detection rate. Next-generation observatories like AXIS will detect X-ray-weak LRDs at z {\\ensuremath{\\sim}} 6 from any viewing angle. Although many SMBHs in the LRDs are already estimated to accrete at super-Eddington rates, our model explains 50\\% of their population by requiring that their masses are overestimated by a mere factor of {\\ensuremath{\\sim}}3. In summary, we suggest that LRDs host slowly spinning SMBHs accreting at mildly super-Eddington rates, with large covering factors and broad emission lines enhanced by strong winds, providing a self-consistent explanation for their X-ray weakness and complementing other models.}",

      "abstract": "{Little red dots (LRDs), a population of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) recently discovered by JWST, show distinctive Balmer-transition features, including prominent Balmer absorption, pronounced Balmer breaks, and large equivalent widths of broad $\\mathrm{H}α$ emission, all of which indicate the presence of dense gas surrounding their central black holes. A further key property of LRDs is their large Balmer decrements with broad $\\mathrm{H}α/\\mathrm{H}β$ line-flux ratios far exceeding the Case B recombination value. These ratios of $\\mathrm{H}α/\\mathrm{H}β>3$ have often been interpreted as evidence for heavy dust extinction ($A\\_Vrsim 3$ mag), however such dust would inevitably produce strong near-to-mid infrared re-emission that is hardly seen in JWST/MIRI observations. To investigate the physical origin of these observed Balmer features, we perform radiation transfer calculations through dust-free, dense gas. We show that the observed large Balmer decrements ($\\mathrm{H}α/\\mathrm{H}β$ and $\\mathrm{H}α/\\mathrm{H}γ$) naturally arise from Balmer resonance scattering without invoking dust. At sufficiently high densities ($n\\_\\mathrm{H} rsim 10^{{8}-{10}}\\textasciitilde \\mathrm{cm^{-3}}$), the elevated multiple Balmer-line ratios converge to values that closely mimic dust reddening, explaining why LRD spectra resemble obscured AGNs. Furthermore, when the Balmer break and broad Balmer lines originate in the same dense gas, their strengths are physically linked, allowing us to constrain the density structure and infer a low broad-line region gas mass of $\\sim O(10\\textasciitilde M\\_\\odot)$. Such a small gas reservoir would be enriched by even a single supernova, implying that LRDs with observed low-metallicity signatures likely experienced minimal star formation in their nuclei.}",

      "abstract": "{The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has discovered a new population of objects, the Little Red Dots (LRDs), characterized by V-shaped spectra indicative of strong breaks around the Balmer limit and compact morphology that gave them their name. A popular explanation is that they are a sub-population of active galactic nuclei/supermassive black holes (AGN/SMBHs) predominantly found in the high-redshift Universe ($zrsim3$). Similarly, direct collapse black holes (DCBHs), theorized to form from collapsing massive, extremely metal-poor gas clouds, have been invoked to explain high-redshift quasars, the most massive AGN sub- population. Here, we employ the semi-analytical code A-SLOTH to produce a population of DCBHs and compare them against observed LRD demographics and properties. Specifically, we compare the DCBH-seeded SMBH population against the standard stellar-remnant seeds and find that DCBH models agree better with observed LRD population statistics and host halo properties. Furthermore, for the most extreme and earliest LRD detections, interpreted to be systems with an AGN but little stellar component, DCBHs are able to reproduce the observed spectral shape and properties under multiple scenarios - high dust attenuation or AGN surrounded by dense gas - that have been proposed to explain the unique shape of LRD spectra. Even when super-Eddington accretion, invoked previously to explain the nature of LRDs, is enforced on stellar remnant seeds, the spectral characteristics of extreme LRDs cannot be reproduced. We emphasize the importance of gas- metallicity observations as an additional dimension besides the widely used SMBH-stellar mass ratios to further constrain the progenitors of LRDs.}",

A cocoon of dense excited gas is emerging as key component to explain the most striking properties of LRDs, such as strong Balmer breaks and Balmer absorption, as well as the weak IR emission. To dissect the structure of LRDs, we analyze new deep JWST/NIRSpec PRISM and G395H spectra of FRESCO-GN-9771, one of the most luminous known LRDs at $z=5.5$. These reveal a strong Balmer break, broad Balmer lines and very narrow [O III] emission. We unveil a forest of optical [Fe II] lines, which we argue is emerging from a dense ($n\\_{\\rm H}=10^{9-10}$ cm$^{-3}$) warm layer with electron temperature $T\\_{\\rm e}\\approx7000$ K. The broad wings of H$α$ and H$β$ have an exponential profile due to electron scattering in this same layer. The high $\\rm Hα:Hβ:Hγ$ flux ratio of $\\approx10.4:1:0.14$ is an indicator of collisional excitation and resonant scattering dominating the Balmer line emission. A narrow H$γ$ component, unseen in the other two Balmer lines due to outshining by the broad components, could trace the ISM of a normal host galaxy with a star formation rate $\\sim5$ M$\\_{\\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$. The warm layer is mostly opaque to Balmer transitions, producing a characteristic P-Cygni profile in the line centers suggesting outflowing motions. This same layer is responsible for shaping the Balmer break. The broad-band spectrum can be reasonably matched by a simple photoionized slab model that dominates the $λ>1500$ {\\r{A}} continuum and a low mass ($\\sim10^8$ M$\\_{\\odot}$) galaxy that could explain the narrow [O III], with only subdominant contribution to the UV continuum.

      "abstract": "{We compile a sample of 83 Little Red Dots (LRDs) with JWST imaging and find that a substantial fraction ($\\sim$43\\%, rising to $rsim$85\\% for the most luminous LRDs) host one or more spatially offset, UV-bright companions at projected separations of $0.5\\rm \\, kpc \\lesssim d\\lesssim 5 \\rm \\,kpc$, with median of $\\langle d \\rangle = 1.0\\,\\mathrm{kpc}$. This fraction is even higher when smaller spatial scales are probed at high S/N ratio: we show that the two most strongly lensed LRDs known to date, A383-LRD and the newly discovered A68-LRD, both have UV- bright companions at separations of only $d\\sim0.3$ kpc, below the resolution limit of most unlensed JWST samples. We explore whether these ubiquitous red/blue configurations may be physically linked to the formation of LRDs, in analogy with the ``synchronized pair'' scenario originally proposed for direct- collapse black hole formation. In this picture, ultraviolet radiation from the companions, which typically have modest stellar masses ($M\\_\\ast \\sim 10^{8-9}M\\_\\odot$), suppresses molecular hydrogen cooling in nearby gas, allowing nearly isothermal collapse and the formation of extremely compact objects, such as massive black holes or quasi-stars. Using component-resolved photometry and SED modeling, we infer Lyman- Werner radiation fields of $J\\_{21,LW} \\sim 10^{2.5}$-$10^{5}$ at the locations of the red components, comparable to those required in direct-collapse models, suggesting that the necessary photodissociation conditions are realized in many LRD systems. This framework provides a simple and self-consistent explanation for the extreme compactness and distinctive spectral properties of LRDs, and links long-standing theoretical models for early compact object formation directly to a population now observed with JWST in the early universe.}",

      "abstract": "{Some of the most puzzling discoveries of NASA's JWST in the early Universe surround the surprising abundance of compact red sources, which show peculiar continuum shapes and broad hydrogen spectral lines. These sources, dubbed ``Little Red Dots'' or LRDs, have been the subject of intense inquiry in the literature. Any of the proposed explanations, from accreting super-massive black holes ensconced in ultra-dense gas to extremely compact star-systems, has significant implications for the earliest phases of galaxy evolution. Part of the difficulty in concretely identifying the physical mechanisms that drive their rest ultra-violet/optical spectral properties is the lack of bona fide signatures -- either star-formation or accreting super-massive black hole, that uniquely discriminate between competing interpretations. In this work, we report the discovery of several spectral features that strongly favor the existence of an accreting super-massive black hole in an LRD witnessed in the first 800 Myr of cosmic time, including several rare iron transitions and a possible [FeVII]. Additionally, we report on the properties of significant Balmer absorption and find that the small widths and relative depths of the absorption feature suggest the source of the absorber is at or beyond the outer edge of the broad-line region and does it fully cover the accreting SMBH in the center of the system. The detection of these iron features, coupled with the properties of the Balmer absorption, unveils an alternative scenario for LRDs -- one where there are direct sight-lines from the accretion disk to gas on scales at (or beyond) the broad-line gas region.}",

We report the discovery of three local LRDs at z = 0.1─0.2, initially selected from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey database, with follow-up optical/near-IR spectroscopy and photometry. They exhibit properties fully consistent with those of high-redshift LRDs, including broad hydrogen and helium emission lines, compact morphologies, V-shaped UV-optical spectral energy distribution, declining near-IR continua, and no significant variability. Two sources were targeted but not detected in X-rays with statistical significance. All three sources show blue-shifted He I absorption, while two exhibit H{\\ensuremath{\\alpha}} and Na D absorption lines. We detect full Balmer and Paschen line series in all three objects, along with abundant narrow [Fe II] emission in two. The emission-line analyses suggest narrow lines originate from AGN-powered, metal- poor regions with minimal dust; broad lines come from inner regions with exceptionally high density or atypical dust properties; and [Fe II] emission arises from dense gas between broad- and narrow-line regions. One of our objects, J1025+1402 (nicknamed ``The Egg''), shows extremely high equivalent width Na D, K I, and Ca II triplet absorption lines, along with other potential low-ionization absorption features, suggesting the presence of a cool ({\\ensuremath{\\sim}}5000 K), metal-enriched gas envelope. The optical/near-IR continua of these LRDs are also consistent with theoretical models featuring an atmosphere around black holes (BHs). The Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer─detected IR emission is consistent with weak dust emission of T {\\ensuremath{\\sim}} {}10$^{2}$─{}10$^{3}$ K. We propose a conceptual model consisting of a largely thermalized cool-gas envelope surrounding the central BH and an extended emission-line region with high-density outflowing gas to explain the observed properties of these local LRDs.}",

      "abstract": "{Recently, the James Webb Space Telescope has revealed a new class of high-redshift (high-z, z > 4) compact galaxies that are red in the rest-frame optical and blue in the rest-frame UV with V-shaped spectral energy distributions (SEDs), referred to as ``little red dots'' (LRDs). It is very likely that LRDs host obscured broad-line active galactic nuclei (AGNs). In the meanwhile, Green Pea galaxies (GPs), which are compact dwarf galaxies at low redshift, share various similar properties with high-redshift star-forming galaxies. Here, we aim to find the connection between the LRDs and GPs hosting broad-line AGNs (BLGPs). With a sample of 19 BLGPs obtained from our previous work, we further identify seven GPs with V-shaped rest-frame UV- to-optical SEDs that are likely local analogs to LRDs. These V-shaped BLGPs exhibit faint UV absolute magnitudes and sub- Eddington rates similar to those of LRDs. Three of them occupy a similar region to LRDs in the Baldwin{\\textendash}Philips{\\textendash}Terlevich diagram, suggesting they have similar ionization conditions and gas-phase metallicities to LRDs. These similarities suggest that V-shaped BLGPs can be taken as local analogs of high-redshift LRDs. In addition, most (16/19) BLGPs, including six V-shaped BLGPs, host overmassive black holes (BHs) above the local M$\\_{BH}${\\textendash}M$\\_{*}$ relation, making it the first sample of galaxies hosting overmassive BHs at z < 0.4. These findings will help us learn more about the formation and coevolution of early galaxies and BHs.}",

      "abstract": "{The unprecedented sensitivity of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has uncovered a surprisingly abundant population of mildly obscured, low-luminosity active galactic nuclei (AGNs) in the epoch of reionization (EoR). However, the link between these objects and classical unobscured quasars remains a mystery. Here we report the discovery of obscured quasars hosted by the most luminous galaxies at z > 6, possibly bridging the gap between the two AGN populations. The 13 objects presented here were originally selected from a rest-frame ultraviolet (UV) imaging survey over >1000 deg$^{2}$, and were known to have luminous (>{}10$^{43}$ erg s$^{‑1}$) Ly{\\ensuremath{\\alpha}} emission. With JWST/NIRSpec follow-up observations, we found that 7 out of 11 objects with narrow Ly{\\ensuremath{\\alpha}} exhibit a broad component in H I Balmer lines and He I lines, but not in [O III] and other forbidden lines. Mild dust obscuration (0 < A$\\_{V}$ < 3) is inferred from the Balmer decrements. The estimated intrinsic luminosities suggest that our broad-line (BL) objects are the long-sought UV-obscured counterparts of luminous quasars in the EoR. They host supermassive black holes (SMBHs) with masses 10$^{7.8‑9.1}$M$\\_{{\\ensuremath{\\odot}}}$, undergoing sub- Eddington to Eddington accretion. Most of the BL objects are spatially unresolved and are close to ``little red dots'' with their blue rest-UV and red rest-optical colors. We estimate the AGN number density among similarly luminous Ly{\\ensuremath{\\alpha}} emitters to be larger than 2 {\\texttimes} 10$^{‑8}$ Mpc$^{‑3}$. This density is comparable to that of classical quasars with similar continuum luminosities, suggesting that a substantial fraction of active SMBHs are obscured in the EoR and have been overlooked in past rest-UV surveys.}",

      "abstract": "{Early results from JWST uncover a peculiar class of objects referred to as ``little red dots'' (LRDs). The extremely compact morphology of LRDs is often invoked to point towards an AGN-dominated picture in the context of their conflicting multiwavelength properties. In this work, we assess the capability of pysersic and GALFIT -- commonly used tools in LRD morphological studies -- to recover input parameters for a simulated suite of LRD-like objects in the F444W band. We find that: 1) these tools have difficulty recovering input parameters for simulated images with SNR $\\lesssim 25$; 2) estimated PSF fraction could be a more robust physically-motivated description of LRD compactness; and 3) almost all permutations of modeled LRDs with SNR $\\lesssim 50$ cannot be differentiated from a point source, regardless of intrinsic extent. This has serious implications on how we interpret morphological results for increasingly large photometric samples of LRDs, especially at extremely high-$z$ or in relatively shallow fields. We present results of Sersic and two-component fitting to a sample of observed LRDs to compare with our mock sample fitting. We find that $\\sim85\\%$ of observed LRDs are PSF-dominated, consistent with the AGN- dominated interpretation. The remaining $\\sim15\\%$ have low estimated PSF fractions (two-component fit) and sizes $rsim 150$ pc (Sersic). This morphological diversity of LRDs suggests that that the population likely is not homogeneous. It possibly has a primary subset of sources consistent with the AGN-dominated hypothesis, and a secondary population of sources more consistent with arising perhaps from extremely compact starbursts.}",

One of the remarkable findings is the identification of ``little red dots'' (LRDs), a unique class of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) with distinct characteristics representing a key phase in the formation and growth of early BHs. Here, we analyze the occurrence rate of LRDs, which emerge around redshifts z {\\ensuremath{\\sim}} 6{\\textendash}8 and sharply decline at z < 4.

This naturally explains the cosmic evolution of AGN abundance over 0 < z < 5, which follows {\\ensuremath{\\propto}}(1 + z)$^{‑5/2}$ due to the cumulative effect of recurring AGN activity.

      "title": "{Investigating the growth of little red dot descendants at z < 4 with the JWST}",
      "abstract": "{Context. One of the most remarkable and unexpected results of the James Webb Space Telescope is the discovery of a population of compact red galaxies: the so-called little red dots (LRDs). The existence of these galaxies raises many questions, including that of their nature and origin, as well as that of their evolution. Indeed, these compact red sources exhibit a pronounced decline in number density by nearly two orders of magnitude from z = 6 to z = 3. Aims. In this paper, we investigate the possible evolution of this galaxy population at a lower redshift. To this end, we have identified a sample of candidates in the CEERS images that could represent the descendants of LRDs by assuming a single evolutionary path: the development of a blue star-forming outskirt while retaining a inner red core. Methods. Our color─magnitude selection identifies red galaxies as red as LRDs at z < 4, defined by a compact, red, inner region and blue outskirts. The red core is associated with the LRD population, while the blue periphery traces recently formed young stars. Morphological properties were derived by fitting single S{\\'e}rsic profiles, while other physical quantities were obtained through spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting, assuming a stellar-only model for both the inner region and the outskirts. Results. The selected galaxies are likely ``post-LRDs'' galaxies, showing similar properties to LRDs under a stellar-only model: stellar masses of M$\\_{*}$ ≍ {}10$^{10}$ M$\\_{{\\ensuremath{\\odot}}}$, central densities {\\ensuremath{\\Sigma}}$\\_{*}$ ≍ {}10$^{11}$ M$\\_{{\\ensuremath{\\odot}}}$ kpc$^{{\\ensuremath{-}}2}$, similar rest-frame red colors, and a {\\ensuremath{\\sim}}1 kpc offset below the size─mass relation. Their number density at z = 3 {\\ensuremath{\\pm}} 0.5 (10$^{{\\ensuremath{-}}4.15}$ Mpc$^{{\\ensuremath{-}}3}$) matches that of LRDs at 5 < z < 7, supporting an evolutionary connection. We find a strong redshift-dependent increase in both outskirts' mass fraction and galaxy size, from {\\ensuremath{\\sim}}250 pc at z = 5 to {\\ensuremath{\\sim}}600 pc at z = 3, indicating overall stellar growth. Meanwhile, the core remains as red and as massive, but the characteristic V shaped SED fades as the extended star- forming envelope becomes dominant. Conclusions. These findings support an evolutionary scenario in which LRDs gradually acquire an extended stellar component over cosmic time by cold accretion. This growth affects the initial LRD state in two key ways: the physical size increases and the characteristic V shaped SED in the core becomes less distinct and disappears. As a result, the original selection criteria based on both of them can no longer identify this population as it evolves, providing an explanation for their observed decline in number density.}",

Their evolution remains unclear, as identifying counterparts at lower redshifts is challenging. We present WISEA J123635.56+621424.2 (here dubbed \\{\\textbackslashit the Saguaro\\}), a $z=2.0145$ galaxy in GOODS- North, as a possible analog of high-redshift LRDs and a potential missing link in their evolutionary path toward lower- redshift systems. It features a compact LRD-like nucleus surrounded by a face-on spiral host. Its connection to LRDs includes that: (1) its nuclear spectrum shows a clear ``V-shaped'' SED; and (2) when redshifted to $z=7$, surface brightness dimming makes the host undetectable, thus mimicking an LRD. This suggests that high-redshift LRDs may be embedded in extended hosts. To test this, we stack rest-frame UV images of 99 photometrically selected LRDs, revealing faint, diffuse emission. Stacking in redshift bins reveals mild radial growth, consistent with the expected galaxy size evolution. A simple analytic model confirms that surface brightness dimming alone can explain their compact appearance. Lastly, we show that \\{\\textbackslashit the Saguaro\\} is not unique by describing similar objects from the literature at $z\\lesssim3.5$. Taken together, our results support a scenario in which LRDs may not be a distinct population, but could be the visible nuclei of galaxies undergoing a short-lived, AGN-dominated evolutionary phase, with their compact, red appearance driven largely by observational biases.}",

The presence of broad Balmer emission lines implies active galactic nuclei powered by supermassive black holes (BHs), while LRDs exhibit unusually weak X-ray and radio emission and low variability, suggesting super-Eddington accretion that obscures the central engine. We suggest that such an extreme accretion disc inevitably drives strong outflows, which would disrupt the LRDs themselves unless confined within the nuclear region ─ posing a general feedback problem for overmassive BHs. To resolve this, we propose that the BH is embedded in a massive, optically thick envelope that gravitationally confines the outflow, making any outflow a no- go. This envelope, powered by accretion on to the BH, radiates at nearly the Eddington limit, and is sustained by an infall of the interstellar medium at a rate on the order of {\\ensuremath{\\sim}}1 . A photosphere emerges either within the envelope or in the infalling medium, with a characteristic temperature of 5000─, near the Hayashi limit. The resulting blackbody emission naturally explains the red optical continuum of the distinct V-shaped spectrum observed in most LRDs. Furthermore, the dynamical time-scale at the photosphere, {\\ensuremath{\\sim}}0.01 pc, is consistent with the observed year-scale variabilities. The nuclear structure and spectral features of LRDs are shaped by this envelope, which not only regulates feedback but also acts as a gas reservoir that sustains rapid BH growth in the early universe.}",

      "abstract": "{Little red dots (LRDs) are a newly identified class of broad-line active galactic nuclei (AGN) with a distinctive v-shape spectrum characterized by red optical and blue UV continuum emission. Their high abundance at redshifts of $z\\sim6-8$ and decline at lower redshifts suggest a transient origin. We propose that the spectral shape of LRDs originates from compact binary black hole systems, where each black hole is surrounded by a mini-disk and embedded in a larger circum-binary disk. With a binary separation of $\\lesssim 10^3$ Schwarzschild radii, the Wien tail of a $T\\simeq 5000\\textasciitilde {\\rm K}$ blackbody spectrum at the inner edge of the circum-binary disk produces the red optical emission, while the mini-disks power the UV continuum. Binary torques carve out a gap between the circum-binary disk and mini-disks, setting the turnover wavelength of the v-shaped spectrum around the Balmer limit. This scenario naturally reproduces LRD spectra requiring only modest dust attenuation ($A\\_V\\lesssim 1$ mag), resolving overestimated luminosities for LRDs in previous studies and alleviating a tension with the so-called Soltan argument. This model predicts a distinct spectral evolution as the binary orbit decays through binary-disk interactions and gravitational waves (GWs), linking early-stage ``proto-LRD'' binaries to the broader AGN population and late-stage ``LRD- descendants'' to coalescing binaries detectable in GW experiments.}",

      "abstract": "{The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has enabled the discovery of hundreds of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) at redshifts $zrsim 4-7$. A non-negligible fraction of these SMBHs are hosted in galaxies with BH-to-galaxy mass ratios ($M\\_{\\rm BH}/M\\_\\star$) being excessively larger than that for local SMBHs by $\\sim 1-2$ dex. The origin of these ``overmassive`` BHs remains elusive, demanding either a heavy seed formation scenario or rapid growth of seed BHs. Their deviation from local scaling relations challenges our understanding of how SMBHs and their host galaxies coevolve across cosmic time. In this paper, we apply phenomenological modelings for BHs and galaxies to dark matter halo merger histories from N-body simulations to investigate the subsequent evolution of JWST-discovered ``overmassive'' SMBHs. We find that early evolution of ``overmassive'' SMBHs is dominated by stunted accretion leading to gradual decreases in $M\\_{\\rm BH}/M\\_\\star$ ratios. In contrast, less massive SMBHs experience super-Eddington accretion during their early evolution, resulting in a slow increase of mass ratios toward $M\\_{\\rm BH}/M\\_\\star \\sim 0.01$. Convergence occurs at $M\\_{\\rm BH}\\sim 10^8\\textasciitilde M\\_\\odot$ with $M\\_{\\rm BH}/M\\_\\star \\sim 0.01$. At lower redshift, nearly all SMBHs evolve onto local relations, as expected given that our models adopt empirical relations derived from low-redshift observations.

Despite extensive study of their characteristic V-shaped SEDs, the nature of LRDs remains unknown. We present a new analysis of the NIRSpec/PRISM spectrum of A2744-QSO1, a triply imaged LRD at z = 7.04 from the UNCOVER survey. The spectrum shows a strong Balmer break and broad Balmer emission lines, both of which are difficult to explain with models invoking exclusively AGN or stellar contributions. Our fiducial model decomposes the spectrum into a post-starburst galaxy dominating the UV-optical continuum and a reddened AGN being subdominant at all wavelengths and contributing at a level of {\\ensuremath{\\sim}}20\\%.

This high central density could be explained if A2744-QSO1 is the early-forming core of a modern-day massive elliptical galaxy that later puffed up via the inside-out growth channel. The models also necessitate an unusually steep dust extinction law to preserve the strong break strength, though this steepness may be explained by a deficit of large dust grains. It is also probable that these challenges reflect our ignorance of A2744-QSO1's true nature. Future variability and reverberation mapping studies could help disentangle the galaxy and AGN contribution to the continuum, and deeper redder observations could also unveil the dust properties in LRDs. *The error code 404 in the title represents that no satisfying model is found for A2744-QSO 1.

We find that GNz7q lies on the local $M\\_{\\rm BH}$-$M\\_*$ relation ($M\\_{\\rm BH}/M\\_*\\simeq 0.001$) and is well positioned to evolve into the locus of massive SDSS quasars with $\\log (M\\_{\\rm BH}/M\\_\\odot)\\approx 9$ and $M\\_*\\approx 10^{11}\\,M\\_\\odot$ at $z\\sim 6$, owing to its remarkably rapid growth in both the black hole and its host galaxy. This stands in stark contrast to many recently reported JWST AGN populations at similar redshifts, including the little red dots (LRDs), whose weak or undetected star formation makes it difficult for them to grow into the massive galaxies hosting SDSS-like quasars. These results suggest that GNz7q marks as a rare, pivotal phase of early BH-galaxy co-eolution, plausibly providing a crucial direct pathway to the supermassive black hole systems within the first billion years of the Universe.}",

Apart from Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and JWST-NIRCam (Near-infrared camera) photometry for these galaxies, there are JWST-NIRSpec spectra for 13 galaxies and mid-infrared photometry (mostly JWST-MIRI) for 15 of them. Spectroscopical analyses included Balmer emission lines, Balmer + 4000 {\\r{A}} breaks or Ca II lines. Spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting with photometry include old and young stellar populations, emission lines associated to H II regions, active galactic nucleus (AGN), interstellar dust extinction, and intergalactic extinction from neutral hydrogen. By adopting realistic extinction curves and taking into account the V-shaped SED and low emission at near-infrared at rest, the analyses show that AGN contribution in these galaxies ('little red dots' most of them) should be small on average in the reddest wavelengths, though important for few of the 31 galaxies. Average age of the 31 galaxies: (95 per cent CL) Gyr, while the average age of the Lambda cold dark matter (CDM) universe is 0.70 Gyr. This corresponds to a formation epoch (97.5 per cent CL). Reddest galaxies present largest ages. One of these very red galaxies gets an age incompatible to be younger than the age of the Universe within . TP-AGB effect cannot explain this tension.

While this may indicate a weaker UV ionizing spectrum in many z > 4 active galactic nuclei or obscuration from dense neutral gas and dust, the complete picture remains unclear owing to the small number of deep rest-UV spectra. Here, we characterize the strength of high-ionization lines in 53 new galaxies observed with NIRSpec R = 2700 grating spectroscopy. We present new detections of narrow N V {\\ensuremath{\\lambda}}1240 in two galaxies. One is a previously confirmed z = 6.98 little red dot (LRD) with broad H{\\ensuremath{\\beta}}, and the other is a z = 8.72 galaxy with a narrow-line spectrum. Neither source exhibits C IV or He II emission, indicating large N V/C IV and N V/He II ratios that may reflect a combination of nitrogen-enhancement and resonant scattering effects. We investigate the incidence of narrow high- ionization lines in a large database of 851 NIRSpec grating spectra, and we separately quantify the fraction of LRDs with narrow high-ionization UV emission lines. Our results likely suggest that hard radiation fields are indeed present in a small subset of LRDs (12.5‑10.4+23.7\\%) and UV-selected galaxies (2.2‑1.0+1.7\\%) at z > 4. The identification of narrow high- ionization lines in the population of LRDs with strong Balmer absorption suggests that the dense neutral hydrogen gas may not uniformly cover the nucleus.

We use a multistep pre-selection and Bayesian fitting to ensure a high- quality sample of sources with broad Balmer lines and narrow forbidden lines.

Notably, these broad-line Type-2 quasars share similar spectral energy distributions with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST)-discovered 'little red dot', suggesting that our sample could be lower redshift analogues of the heavily obscured broad-line AGNs uncovered by JWST. We also find that the [O III] 5007 emission is relatively weak for their high-bolometric luminosities, deviating from trends seen in lower-z Type-2 quasi-stellar objects (QSOs). A new composite spectrum for Type-2 QSOs is built using our sample. Overall, our results demonstrate that mid-infrared selection efficiently uncovers diverse populations of obscured quasars and that spectroscopic follow-up is crucial for revealing their true nature. This study provides new insights into heavily obscured supermassive black hole growth at cosmic noon and bridges the gap to the obscured active galactic nuclei populations being revealed by JWST.}",

We report the discovery of three local LRDs at $z = 0.1-0.2$, initially selected from the SDSS database, with follow-up optical/near-IR spectroscopy and photometry. They exhibit properties fully consistent with those of high-redshift LRDs, including broad hydrogen and helium emission lines, compact morphologies, V-shaped UV-optical SED, declining near-IR continua, and no significant variability. Two sources were targeted but not detected in X-rays with statistical significance. All three sources show blue-shifted He I absorption, while two exhibit H$α$ and Na D absorption lines. We detect full Balmer and Paschen line series in all three objects, along with abundant narrow [Fe II] emission in two. The emission line analyses suggest narrow lines originate from AGN-powered metal-poor regions with minimal dust; broad lines come from inner regions with exceptionally high density or atypical dust properties; and [Fe II] emission arises from dense gas between broad and narrow-line regions. One of our objects, J1025+1402 (nicknamed ``The Egg''), shows extremely high equivalent width Na D, K I, Fe II, and Ca II triplet absorption lines, suggesting the presence of a cool ($\\sim$5000 K), metal-enriched gas envelope. The optical/near-IR continua of these LRDs are also consistent with theoretical models featuring an atmosphere around black holes. The WISE-detected IR emission is consistent with weak dust emission of $T \\sim 10^2-10^3$ K. We propose a conceptual model consisting of a largely thermalized cool-gas envelope surrounding the central black hole and an extended emission line region with high-density outflowing gas to explain the observed properties of these local LRDs.}",

This population consists of a well-known subset called little red dots (LRDs) and the remaining non-LRDs. If all of these broad H{\\ensuremath{\\alpha}} emitters were attributed to type 1─1.9 active galactic nuclei (AGNs), it would imply a significantly higher number density of low-luminosity AGNs than extrapolated from that of more luminous AGNs. Here, we have examined the rest-frame ultraviolet (UV)-optical flux variability of three LRD and two non-LRD broad H{\\ensuremath{\\alpha}} emitters using multiepoch, multiband JWST/NIRCam imaging data. The rest-frame temporal sampling interval of the NIRCam data ({\\ensuremath{\\sim}}400─500 days/(1 + z)) is comparable to typical variability timescales of AGNs with black hole masses of M$\\_{BH}$ {\\ensuremath{\\sim}} {}10$^{7}$ M$\\_{{\\ensuremath{\\odot}}}$; thus, the flux variations should be detectable if AGNs were present. However, no measurable flux variation over the rest-frame wavelength range of {\\ensuremath{\\lambda}}$\\_{rest}$ {\\ensuremath{\\sim}} 1500─9000 {\\r{A}} has been detected, placing stringent upper limits on the variability amplitudes. This result, combined with the X-ray faintness confirmed by the ultradeep Chandra data, indicates that, under the AGN scenario, we need to postulate peculiar Compton-thick broad-line AGNs with either (a) an intrinsically nonvariable AGN disk continuum, (b) a host galaxy-dominated continuum, or (c) scattering-dominated AGN emission. Alternatively, (d) they could be non-AGNs where the broad-line emission originates from unusually fast and dense/low- metallicity star formation-driven outflows or inelastic Raman scattering of stellar UV continua by neutral hydrogen atoms.}",

      "abstract": "{Recent James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) observations have revealed a population of sources with a compact morphology and a characteristic `v-shaped' continuum, namely blue at rest-frame $λ<4000$A and red at longer wavelengths. The nature of these sources, called `little red dots' (LRDs), is still debated, as it is unclear if they host active galactic nuclei (AGN) and their number seems to drastically drop at z<4. We take advantage of the $63 °^2$ covered by the quick Euclid Quick Data Release (Q1) to extend the search for LRDs to brighter magnitudes and to lower redshifts than what has been possible with JWST. The selection is performed by fitting the available photometric data (Euclid, the Spitzer Infrared Array Camera (IRAC), and ground- based $griz$ data) with two power laws, to retrieve both the rest-frame optical and UV slopes consistently over a large redshift range (i.e, z<7.6). We exclude extended objects and possible line emitters, and perform a careful visual inspection to remove any imaging artefacts. The final selection includes 3341 LRD candidates at z=0.33-3.6, with 29 detected also in IRAC. The resulting rest-frame UV luminosity function, in contrast with previous JWST studies, shows that the number density of LRD candidates increases from high-z down to z=1.5-2.5 and decreases at lower z. However, less evolution is apparent focusing on the subsample of more robust LRD candidates having IRAC detections, which however has low statistics and limited by the IRAC resolution. The comparison with previous quasar (QSO) UV luminosity functions shows that LRDs are not the dominant AGN population at z<4 and $M\\_{\\rm UV}<-21$. Follow-up studies of these LRD candidates are pivotal to confirm their nature, probe their physical properties and check for their compatibility with JWST sources, given the different spatial resolution and wavelength coverage of Euclid and JWST.}",

      "abstract": "{The population of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) newly discovered by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) exhibits peculiar properties that distinguish it from both local type I AGN and high-redshift quasars. Most of these sources are compact, appearing as 'little dots': among them, the sub-class (10-30\\% of the total) characterized by significantly red optical colors has been named 'Little Red Dots' (LRDs), while here we analogously introduce the term 'Little Blue Dots' (LBDs) for the remaining, bluer sources (70-90\\%). We then present a comparative analysis of the prototypical representatives ('Rosetta Stones') of the two classes: GN-28074 at z=2.26, the Red Rosetta Stone, and GS-3073 at z=5.55, the Blue Rosetta Stone. In both Rosetta Stones the broad Balmer lines are better described by exponential profiles rather than single Gaussians, similarly to normal low-redshift type I AGN, indicating that exponential profiles are not unique to LRDs. They are both extremely X-ray weak, show strong auroral [OIII] 4363 emission, weak hot dust mid-IR emission, and no time variability. However, they differ in terms of excitation diagnostics: the HeII 4686 line is undetected in the Red Rosetta but strongly detected in the Blue Rosetta in both narrow and broad components, with the latter much broader than hydrogen Balmer lines. This supports BLR stratification and disfavors the cocoon electron-scattering scenario. An additional difference is the presence of prominent Balmer absorption in the Red Rosetta -- indicative of extremely dense gas along the line of sight -- but absent in the Blue Rosetta. Taken together, these results suggest that LRDs and LBDs share the same central engine as standard type I AGN, while differing in the amount and geometry of dense gas surrounding the accretion disk, and/or in their accretion properties.}",

      "abstract": "{Little red dots (LRDs), newly identified compact and dusty galaxies with an unexpectedly high number density observed by JWST, have an unusual ``V-shaped'' rest-frame UV to near-infrared spectral energy distribution (SED). A group of hyperluminous, obscured quasars with excess blue emission, called blue-excess hot dust- obscured galaxies (BHDs), also exhibit qualitatively similar SEDs to those of LRDs. They represent a rare population of galaxies hosting supermassive black holes (SMBHs) accreting near the Eddington limit at redshifts z {\\ensuremath{\\sim}} 1{\\textendash}4. In this study, we compare their multiwavelength SEDs to investigate whether LRDs, or a subset of them, could be high-redshift analogs of BHDs. Our analysis reveals that despite their similar ``V-shape'' SEDs, LRDs appear to be a different population than BHDs. The ``V-shape'' of BHDs appears at longer wavelengths compared to LRDs due to different selection strategies, suggesting LRDs have much less dust attenuation than typical BHDs. The bluer colors in the rest-frame infrared (continuum) emission of LRDs suggest the absence of hot dust heated by active galactic nuclei (AGN) accretion activities. We also argue that the blue excess in LRDs is unlikely from AGN scattered light. The compact morphologies and lower X-ray detection frequencies of LRDs suggest a distinct formation pathway from BHDs, which are thought to be powered by super- Eddington accretion onto central SMBHs following major galaxy mergers.}",

The nature of LRDs is controversial. Recently, several studies have investigated LRDs through variability, a characteristic feature of AGNs. These studies explore LRD variability by extrapolating empirical relationships from local quasars. Here, we adopt the Corona-heated Accretion- disk Reprocessing (CHAR) model, which is motivated by accretion physics and is applicable to reproducing AGN conventional variability, to study the variability of 22 LRDs in W. L. Tee et al. Our results indicate that the observed variability in LRDs is dominated by measurement uncertainties. Within the CHAR model, the lack of variability in LRDs can be explained by two scenarios: either AGNs contribute {\\ensuremath{\\lesssim}}30\\% of the observed luminosities, or they are intrinsically luminous AGNs. We use simulations to demonstrate the observational requirements to effectively investigate LRDs via variability with the following criteria: first, the sample has about 200 LRDs; second, each LRD has two observations separated by at least 2 yr in the observed frame; third, the photometric uncertainty is {\\ensuremath{\\leq}}0.07 mag. If the LRDs still lack variability under these conditions, the time{\\textendash}domain study would provide independent evidence that the accretion mode of LRDs differs significantly from low- redshift quasars.}",

      "abstract": "{The JWST has uncovered a new population of candidate broad-line active galactic nucleus (AGN) emerging in the early Universe, named 'little red dots' (LRDs) because of their compactness and red colours at optical wavelengths. LRDs appear to be surprisingly abundant (<inline-formula><tex-math>${\\approx} 10^{-5} \\, {\\rm cMpc}^{-3}$</tex-math></inline-formula>) given that their inferred bolometric luminosities largely overlap with those of the ultraviolet (UV)-luminous quasars identified at high z in wide-field spectroscopic surveys. In this work, we investigate how the population of LRDs and/or other UV-obscured AGN relates to the one of unobscured, UV-selected quasars. By comparing their number densities, we infer an extremely large and rapidly evolving obscured:unobscured ratio, ranging from <inline- formula><tex-math>${\\approx} 20{:}1$</tex-math></inline-formula> at <inline-formula><tex-math>$z\\approx 4$</tex-math></inline- formula> to <inline-formula><tex-math>${\\approx} 2300{:}1$</tex- math></inline-formula> at <inline-formula><tex-math>$z\\approx 7$</tex-math></inline-formula>, and possibly extending out to very high (<inline-formula><tex-math>${\\approx} 10^{47}\\, {\\rm erg}\\, {\\rm s}^{-1}$</tex-math></inline-formula>) bolometric luminosities.

This implies that either (a) the bolometric luminosities of LRDs are strongly overestimated or (b) LRDs follow different scaling relations than those of UV-selected quasars, representing a new population of accreting supermassive black holes emerging in the early Universe. A direct comparison between the clustering of LRDs and that of faint UV-selected quasars will ultimately confirm these findings and shed light on key properties of LRDs such as their host mass distribution and duty cycle.

A popular explanation is that they are a subpopulation of active galactic nuclei (AGN) and/or supermassive black holes (SMBHs) predominantly found in the high-redshift Universe (z {\\ensuremath{\\gtrsim}} 3). Similarly, direct collapse black holes (DCBHs), theorized to form from collapsing massive, extremely metal-poor gas clouds, have been invoked to explain high-redshift quasars, the most massive AGN subpopulation. Here, we employ the semianalytical code A-SLOTH to produce a population of DCBHs and compare them against observed LRD demographics and properties. Specifically, we compare the DCBH- seeded SMBH population against the standard stellar-remnant seeds and find that the DCBH models agree better with the observed LRD population statistics and host halo properties. Furthermore, for the most extreme and earliest LRD detections, interpreted to be systems with an AGN but small stellar component, DCBHs are able to reproduce the observed spectral shape and properties under multiple scenarios{\\textemdash}high dust attenuation or AGN surrounded by dense gas{\\textemdash}that have been proposed to explain the unique shape of LRD spectra. Even when super-Eddington accretion, invoked previously to explain the nature of LRDs, is enforced on stellar-remnant seeds, the spectral characteristics of extreme LRDs cannot be reproduced. We emphasize the importance of gas-metallicity observations as an additional dimension besides the widely used SMBH to stellar mass ratios to further constrain the progenitors of LRDs.}",

These objects exhibit unusual spectral features reminiscent of stellar spectra with blackbody-like SEDs, large hydrogen Balmer breaks, Balmer line absorption, and classical stellar absorption features such as calcium H\\&K and the calcium triplet. Following the recent suggestion that these may be actively accreting direct-collapse black holes in the process of assembly, i.e. quasi-stars, we present evolutionary models of quasi-stars using our recently released, publicly available MESA-QUEST modeling framework. We compute a grid of models spanning a range of black hole masses and predict the luminosities, temperatures, surface gravities, and lifetimes of these objects. We find that these models lie along a Hayashi track once they hit their ``late-stage'' which constitutes the majority of their lives ($\\sim 20$\\raisebox{-0.5ex}\\textasciitildeMyr). We present scaling relations for estimating the mass of a quasi-star as a function of the bolometric luminosity, as well as the bolometric luminosity as a function of the effective temperature for the Hayashi track. The short lifetimes in tandem with the observed number density of LRDs imply the possibility that every supermassive black hole was once a quasi-star. We compare synthetic spectra of our quasi-star models to observations of LRDs, and show that these models are broadly capable of reproducing the continuum spectra of observed LRDs. These results indicate that quasi-stars are promising candidates for the origin of supermassive black holes via direct collapse in the early universe.}",

      "abstract": "{The physical origin of little red dots (LRDs){\\textemdash}compact extragalactic sources with red rest-optical continua and broad Balmer lines{\\textemdash}remains elusive. The redness of LRDs is likely intrinsic, suggesting optically thick gas emitting at a characteristic effective temperature of {\\ensuremath{\\sim}}5000 K. Meanwhile, many LRD spectra exhibit a Balmer break, often attributed to absorption by a dense gas shell surrounding an active galactic nucleus. Using semianalytical atmosphere models and radiation transport calculations, we show that a super- Eddington accretion system can give rise to a Balmer break and a red optical color simultaneously, without invoking external gas absorption for the break or dust reddening. The break originates from a discontinuity in opacity across the Balmer limit, similar to that of early-type stars, but the lower photosphere density of super-Eddington systems, {\\ensuremath{\\rho}} < 10$^{{\\ensuremath{-}}9}$ g cm$^{{\\ensuremath{-}}3}$, implies a significant opacity contrast even at a cool photosphere temperature of {\\ensuremath{\\sim}}5000 K. Furthermore, while accretion in the form of a standard thin disk requires fine tuning to match the optical color of LRDs, an alternative scenario of a geometrically thick, roughly spherical accretion flow implies an effective temperature of 4000 K {\\ensuremath{\\lesssim}} T$\\_{eff}$ {\\ensuremath{\\lesssim}} 6000 K that is very insensitive to the accretion rate (analogous to the Hayashi line in stellar models). The continuum spectra from the latter scenario align with the Balmer break and optical color of currently known LRDs. We discuss the predictions of our model and the prospects for more realistic spectra based on super- Eddington accretion simulations.}",

      "abstract": "{JWST has revealed a population of compact and extremely red galaxies at z {\\ensuremath{\\gtrsim}} 4, which likely host active galactic nuclei (AGNs). We present a sample of 434 ``little red dots'' (LRDs), selected from the 0.54 deg$^{2}$ COSMOS-Web survey. We fit galaxy and AGN spectral energy distribution models to derive redshifts and physical properties; the sample spans z {\\ensuremath{\\sim}} 5{\\textendash}9 after removing brown dwarf contaminants. As a thought experiment, we consider two extreme physical scenarios: either LRDs are all AGNs, and their continuum emission is dominated by the accretion disk, or they are all compact star-forming galaxies, and their continuum is dominated by stars. If LRDs are AGN-dominated, our sample exhibits bolometric luminosities {\\ensuremath{\\sim}}10$^{45‑47}$ erg s$^{‑1}$, spanning the gap between JWST AGNs in the literature and bright, rare quasars. We derive a bolometric luminosity function (LF) {\\ensuremath{\\sim}} 100 times the (UV- selected) quasar LF, implying a nonevolving black hole accretion density of {\\ensuremath{\\sim}}10$^{‑4}$M$\\_{{\\ensuremath{\\odot}}}$ yr$^{‑1}$ Mpc$^{‑3}$ from z {\\ensuremath{\\sim}} 2{\\textendash}9. By contrast, if LRDs are dominated by star formation, we derive stellar masses {\\ensuremath{\\sim}}10$^{8.5‑10}$ M$\\_{{\\ensuremath{\\odot}}}$. MIRI/F770W is key to deriving accurate stellar masses; without it, we derive a mass function inconsistent with {\\ensuremath{\\Lambda}} cold dark matter. The median stellar mass profile is broadly consistent with the maximal surface densities seen in the nearby Universe, though the most massive objects exceed this limit, requiring substantial AGN contribution to the continuum. Nevertheless, stacking all available X-ray, mid-IR, far-IR/submillimeter, and radio data yields nondetections. Whether dominated by dusty AGNs or compact star-formation, the high masses/luminosities and remarkable abundance of LRDs implies a dominant mode of early galaxy/SMBH growth.}",

Among the most intriguing JWST discoveries are red, very compact objects that show broad line emission features, nicknamed little red dots (LRDs). The discovery of LRDs has triggered great interest in their origin as either extremely starbursting galaxies or highly obscured active galactic nuclei (AGNs). Their exact nature remains unknown. Aims. The goal of this work is to estimate the radio emission from LRDs and predict which radio surveys would detect them. To achieve these objectives, we employed the fundamental plane of black hole (BH) accretion to estimate radio emission from AGNs and the stellar radio fluxes from their host galaxies. We assumed a range of BH masses, X-ray luminosities (L$\\_{X}$), and star formation rates (SFRs) to bracket the likely properties of LRDs. Methods. Our findings suggest that BH radio fluxes from LRDs are 10{\\textendash}100 times higher than the stellar fluxes from their host galaxies, depending on the BH mass, L$\\_{X}$, and SFR. The detection of a {\\ensuremath{\\sim}}500 nJy signal above 2 GHz at z {\\ensuremath{\\geq}} 5 or a {\\ensuremath{\\sim}}2000 nJy flux at z = 3{\\textendash}4 would be a smoking gun for the presence of AGNs provided that SFRs in the host galaxies are < 30 M$\\_{{\\ensuremath{\\odot}}}$ yr$^{‑1}$. Results. We find that LRDs are most likely radio-quiet AGNs; otherwise, they would have already been detected in the current radio surveys.

These are a blue rest-frame ultraviolet slope, compact size, and a broad H$α$ line (all of which are characteristic of LRDs), but a flatter rest-frame optical slope compared to that observed in LRDs.

      "abstract": "{Recently discovered supermassive black holes with masses of at redshifts ─11 in active galactic nuclei (AGNs) pose severe challenges to our understanding of supermassive black hole formation. One proposed channel are rapidly accreting supermassive PopIII stars (SMSs) that form in large primordial gas haloes and grow up to . They eventually collapse due to the general relativistic instability and could lead to supernova- like explosions. This releases massive and energetic ejecta that then interact with the halo medium via an optically thick shock. We develop a semi-analytic model to compute the shock properties, bolometric luminosity, emission spectrum, and photometry over time. The initial data are informed by stellar evolution and general relativistic SMS collapse simulations. We find that SMS explosion light curves reach a brightness and last 10─200 yr in the source frame ─ up to 250─3000 yr with cosmic time dilation. This makes them quasi-persistent sources which vary indistinguishably to little red dots and AGN within 0.5─ yr. Bright SMS explosions are observable in long-wavelength JWST (James Webb Space Telescope) filters up to (24─26 mag) and pulsating SMSs up to . EUCLID and the Roman Space Telescope (RST) can detect SMS explosions at ─12. Their deep fields could constrain the SMS rate down to Mpcyr, which is much deeper than JWST bounds. Based on cosmological simulations and observed star formation rates, we expect to image up to several hundred SMS explosions with EUCLID and dozens with RST deep fields.}",

      "abstract": "{One of JWST's most remarkable discoveries is a population of compact red galaxies known as Little Red Dots (LRDs). Their existence raises many questions about their nature, origin, and evolution. These galaxies show a steep decline in number density-nearly two orders of magnitude-from $z=6$ to $z=3$. In this study, we explore their potential evolution by identifying candidate descendants in CEERS, assuming a single evolutionary path: the development of a blue star-forming outskirt around the red compact core. Our color-magnitude selection identifies galaxies as red as LRDs at $z<4$, surrounded by young, blue stellar outskirts. Morphological parameters were derived from single S{\\'e}rsic profile fits; physical properties were obtained from SED fitting using a stellar-only model. These ``post-LRD'' candidates show LRD-like features with $M\\_\\ast \\sim 10^{10} \\ M\\_\\odot $, central densities ($ Σ\\_\\ast \\sim 10^{11} \\ M\\_\\odot \\ \\text{kpc}^{-2}$ ), compact sizes, and red rest-frame colors, but with an added extended component. Their number density at $z = 3 \\pm 0.5$ ( $ \\sim 10^{-4.15} \\, \\text{Mpc}^{-3} $) matches that of LRDs at $5 < z < 7$ , supporting a possible evolutionary link. We observe a redshift-dependent increase in outskirts mass fraction and galaxy size-from $\\sim 250$ pc at $ z = 5 $ to $\\sim 600$ pc at $ z = 3 $-suggesting global stellar growth. Meanwhile, the core remains red and compact, but the V-shape fades as the outskirts grow. These findings support an evolutionary scenario in which LRDs gradually acquire an extended stellar component over cosmic time by cold accretion. This may explain the apparent decline in their observed number density at lower redshift.}",

They are characterized by a red color in the rest-frame optical band, compact morphology, and broad Balmer emission lines (${\\rm FWHM} rsim 1000\\textasciitilde {\\rm km\\,s^{-1}}$) that suggest an AGN nature. Using a method of pixel-by-pixel color selection and relaxing the compactness criteria, we identify three of the first dual LRD candidates in the COSMOS-Web survey with projected separations of $0.\\!\\!^{\\prime\\prime}2-0.\\!\\!^{\\prime\\prime}4$ (1-2 pkpc at their photometric redshifts). A comparison between existing LRD samples and mock data reveals that the projected separations of these dual LRD candidates are unlikely to result from chance projections of objects at different redshifts. In one case (CW-B5-15958), the dual LRD includes two bright sources ($m\\_{\\rm F444W}=24.3$ and $24.8$) with characteristic V-shape spectral energy distribution (SEDs) and photometric redshifts consistent with each other. We find that CW-B5-15958 has a faint off- centered component and a companion galaxy. In the other two dual systems, the brighter LRD exhibits a V-shape SED, while the fainter LRD ($m\\_{\\rm F444W}rsim26$) is undetected in both F115W and F150W. These discoveries suggest that the angular auto- correlation function (ACF) of LRDs exhibits a significant excess ($\\sim3\\times10^2$ times) on sub-arcsec (kilo-parsec) separations compared to the extrapolation of a power-law ACF of JWST-found AGNs measured over $10^{\\prime\\prime}-100^{\\prime\\prime}$.

To this aim, we build a realistic comparison between LRD observations with photometric properties of galaxies and AGN simulated by the L-GalaxiesBH model in a NIRCam mock sky. We model stellar continua and emission lines, the MBH emission from accretion disk, infrared radiation from dusty torus, and lines from narrow and broad line regions, accounting for dust attenuation and obscuration. Using realistic photometric cuts, we select a population of LRDs including both AGN and galaxies. The LRD fraction peaks at 40\\% ($\\sim10^{-4}\\rm Mpc^{-3}$) at $z\\sim4$. Our LRDs are central galaxies spanning $M\\_*=10^8-10^{10.5}\\rm M\\_\\odot$. A population of galaxies with $M\\_*<10^9\\rm M\\_\\odot$ appear as LRDs due to older stellar populations.

Our analysis demonstrates that SEDs with red optical and blue UV continua are very common in HRQs, with more than 82 per cent of the sample showing a UV-excess relative to the reddened quasar continuum. We model the SEDs by combining a reddened quasar and an unobscured scattered light component, though contributions from a star-forming host galaxy cannot be ruled out. The average scattering fraction is small (0.3 per cent). Higher scattering fractions are ruled out by the (i-K)=2.5 colour-cut used to select HRQs which pre-dates the discovery of the JWST ``Little Red Dot'' (LRD) population. Hence, LRDs generally have bluer UV continua. Nevertheless, four HRQs satisfy the LRD UV/optical continuum slope selections and are therefore massive, cosmic noon analogues of LRDs. Analysis of the near-infrared SEDs of HRQs reveals a deficit of hot dust relative to blue quasars, similar to what is observed in LRDs. This suggests HRQs trace a phase where strong AGN feedback processes eject dust from the inner torus. The UV scattering fraction of HRQs is weakly correlated with the amount of hot dust emission and anti- correlated with the line-of-sight extinction, E(B-V). This is consistent with the hot dust acting as the scattering medium, and the line-of-sight extinction being dominated by dust on interstellar medium scales in the host galaxy.}",

      "abstract": "{The real nature of little red dots (LRDs), a class of very compact galaxies in the early Universe recently discovered by the James Webb Space Telescope, is still poorly understood. The most popular theories competing to interpret the phenomena include active galactic nuclei and enhanced star formation in dusty galaxies. To date, however, neither model gives a completely satisfactory explanation to the population as a whole; thus, alternative theories have arisen, including tidal disruption events (TDEs). By considering observational constraints on the radio emission of LRDs, we discuss whether TDEs are adequate alternatives solving these high-redshift enigmas. We utilise radio flux density upper limits from LRD stacking analyses, TDE peak radio luminosities, and volumetric density estimates. We find that the characteristic values of flux densities and luminosities allow radio-quiet TDEs as the underlying process of LRDs in any case, while the less common radio-loud TDEs are compatible with the model under special constraints only. Considering other factors, such as volumetric density estimates, delayed and long-term radio flares of TDEs, and cosmological time dilation, TDEs appear to be a plausible explanation for LRDs from the radio point of view.}",

The less massive and fainter galaxies in ASTRID lack the dust concentration necessary to produce the red slope of an LRD, though this could be an effect of limited resolution. Most of the highest Eddington black holes are not LRDs due to insufficient dust attenuation from their host galaxies, which are also experiencing relatively high star formation rates.

These objects exhibit unusual spectral features reminiscent of stellar spectra with blackbody-like spectral energy distributions, large hydrogen Balmer breaks, Balmer line absorption, and classical stellar absorption features such as calcium H\\&K and the calcium triplet. Following the recent suggestion that these may be actively accreting direct-collapse black holes in the process of assembly, i.e., quasi-stars, we present evolutionary models of quasi-stars using our recently released, publicly available MESA-QUEST modeling framework. We compute a grid of models spanning a range of black hole masses and predict the luminosities, temperatures, surface gravities, and lifetimes of these objects. We find that these models lie along a Hayashi track once they hit their ``late stage,'' which constitutes the majority of their lives ({\\ensuremath{\\sim}}20 Myr). We present scaling relations for estimating the mass of a quasi-star as a function of the bolometric luminosity, as well as the bolometric luminosity as a function of the effective temperature for the Hayashi track. The short lifetimes in tandem with the observed number density of LRDs imply the possibility that every supermassive black hole detected at these epochs was once a quasi-star. We compare synthetic spectra of our quasi- star models to observations of LRDs, and show that these models are broadly capable of reproducing the continuum spectra of observed LRDs. These results indicate that quasi-stars are promising candidates for the origin of supermassive black holes via direct collapse in the early Universe.}",

In this framework, dark matter halos undergo gravothermal core collapse due to large self-interaction cross sections, resulting in the rapid formation of massive black hole (BH) seeds with masses $rsim 10^{5} M\\_\\odot$ at redshifts $z rsim 5$. We develop a semi-analytic model that tracks the evolution of the dark matter halo population, the redshift of collapse $z\\_{\\rm coll}$, and the corresponding BH mass function. Black hole growth is modeled stochastically via a log-normal Eddington ratio distribution and a finite duty cycle. We find that the uSIDM scenario naturally reproduces key observed properties of LRDs, including their abundance, compactness, and characteristic BH masses, while offering a mechanism for early, obscured black hole formation that is difficult to achieve in standard CDM- based models. The predicted SMBH mass function at $z \\sim 5$ shows excellent agreement with LRD observational data and SIDM merger-tree simulations, particularly at the high-mass end $(m\\_{\\rm BH} rsim 10^{7} M\\_\\odot)$.

Focusing on the ULDM Jeans scale, we identify the critical conditions under which high-redshift baryonic gas, strongly confined by central solitonic cores of the halos, undergoes direct and monolithic collapse. The solitonic potential naturally drives rapid inflow and shock heating, allowing the gas to exceed the critical atomic-cooling and fragmentation-suppression threshold of $\\sim 3 \\times 10^4 {\\rm K}$ without invoking an external UV background. We derive semi- analytic relations for the halo mass, soliton mass, baryonic core radius, and thermodynamic state of the gas, including the effects of baryonic contraction. These relations simultaneously determine the minimum and maximum SMBH seed masses as functions of redshift. In this framework, pristine gas clouds that satisfy the temperature threshold collapse without fragmentation, forming SMBH seeds with characteristic masses of order $\\sim 10^5M\\_\\odot$, while systems below the threshold are expected to form compact star clusters instead. Our model also implies an upper limit on the attainable SMBH mass, predicting a maximum mass scale of order $\\sim10^{10}M\\_\\odot$, consistent with the most massive quasars observed to date. The ULDM particle mass required to reproduce the inferred seed mass scale, $m \\simeq 10^{-22}{\\rm eV}$, coincides with the value favored by galactic- scale observations, providing a unified explanation for the characteristic masses of both galactic cores and early SMBH seeds.

Our EPOCHS v1 sample includes 1120 galaxy candidates at 6.5 < z < 13.5 taken from a consistent reduction and analysis of publicly available deep JWST NIRCam data covering the Prime Extragalactic Areas for Reionization Science, CEERS, GLASS, JADES GOOD-S, NGDEEP, and SMACS0723 surveys, totaling 187 arcmin$^{2}$. We investigate the impact of spectral energy distribution fitting methods, assumed star formation histories (SFHs), dust laws, and priors on galaxy masses and the resultant GSMF. While our fiducial GSMF agrees with the literature at z < 13.5, we find that the assumed SFH model has a large impact on the GSMF and stellar mass density (SMD), finding a 0.75 dex increase in the SMD at z = 10.5 between a flexible nonparametric and standard parametric SFH. Overall, we find a flatter SMD evolution at z {\\ensuremath{\\geq}} 9 than some studies predict, suggesting a rapid buildup of stellar mass in the early Universe. We find no incompatibility between our results and those of standard cosmological models, as suggested previously, although the most massive galaxies may require a high star formation efficiency. We find that the ``little red dot'' galaxies dominate the z = 7 GSMF at high masses, necessitating a better understanding of the relative contributions of active galactic nucleus and stellar emission. We show that assuming a theoretically motivated top-heavy initial mass function (IMF) reduces stellar mass by 0.5 dex without affecting fit quality, but our results remain consistent with existing cosmological models with a standard IMF.}",

We find remarkable similarities between ULASJ2315+0143 and the high-redshift little red dots (LRDs). The rest-frame UV cannot be explained by a dusty quasar component alone and requires an additional blue component consistent with either a star-forming host galaxy or scattered AGN light. We detect broad high-ionization emission lines in the rest-UV, supporting the scattered light interpretation for the UV excess. The scattering fraction represents just 0.05 per cent of the total luminosity of ULASJ2315+0143 . Analysis of the mid- infrared SED suggests an absence of hot dust on torus-scales similar to what is observed for LRDs. The obscuring medium is therefore likely on galaxy scales. We detect narrow, blueshifted associated absorption-line systems in C IV, N V, Si IV, and Si III. There is evidence for significant high-velocity (>1000 ) outflows in both the broad- and narrow-line regions as traced by C IV and [O III] emission. The kinetic power of the [O III] wind is .

The extremely compact morphologies of these LRDs are often invoked to point towards an active galactic nucleus (AGN)-dominated picture in the context of their conflicting multiwavelength properties. In this work, we assess the capability of pysersic and GALFIT{\\textemdash}commonly used tools in LRD morphological studies{\\textemdash}to recover input parameters for a simulated suite of LRD-like objects in the F444W band. We find that (1) these tools have difficulty recovering input parameters for simulated images with signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) {\\ensuremath{\\lesssim}} 25; (2) estimated point-spread function (PSF) fraction could be a more robust physically motivated description of LRD compactness; and (3) almost all permutations of modeled LRDs with SNR {\\ensuremath{\\lesssim}} 50 cannot be differentiated from a point source, regardless of intrinsic extent. This has serious implications on how we interpret morphological results for increasingly large photometric samples of LRDs, especially at extremely high z or in relatively shallow fields.

      "abstract": "{The James Webb Space Telescope has unveiled an abundant population of potential active galactic nuclei (AGN) at high redshift ($zrsim4$) known as little red dots (LRDs), which are likely hosted in relatively low-mass galaxies. However, previous theoretical models have highlighted the difficulty in continuously feeding massive black holes in the central regions of bursty, high-redshift galaxies because of repeated gas evacuation by stellar feedback. We analyze galaxies in high- redshift FIRE-2 simulations to understand whether they are capable of hosting the observed abundant population of high- redshift AGN. We use a gravitational torque-driven accretion (GTDA) model and a simple free-fall accretion model to derive black hole accretion rates and construct predicted AGN bolometric luminosity functions for $z=5-7$. The GTDA model and the free-fall model with black holes accreting $\\lesssim 1$ percent of their central gas supply ($<100 \\rm \\ pc$) per free- fall time predict AGN abundances that are more than sufficient to explain the most recent LRD observations. The fiducial models, in fact, overpredict the number of low-luminosity AGN as compared with observations. We explore possible resolutions of this tension. A plausible, though likely not unique, scenario for alleviating the AGN overpredictions and which also provides a good match to the host-galaxy UV luminosity distribution suggests that LRDs are super Eddington-accreting, Eddington luminosity-limited, $M\\_{\\rm BH}rsim 2\\times10^5 \\ \\rm M\\_\\odot$ black holes residing in $M\\_\\star rsim 2\\times10^7 \\ \\rm M\\_\\odot$ galaxies.}",

We propose that LRDs may trace a short-lived, obscured phase associated with rapid baryonic inflow inside the deep solitonic cores of fuzzy dark matter (FDM) halos. Combining the soliton size scaling with (i) the observed compact radii ($r\\_e \\sim 30-100$ pc) and (ii) the requirement that Compton-thick columns be achievable within a region of order the core radius, we find that particle masses $m$ few $\\times 10^{-22}$ eV are plausible for soliton masses $M\\_s \\sim 10^8 - 10^9 M\\_\\odot$; we adopt $m\\_{22}=2$ as a fiducial choice. A conservative mass-budget estimate for the obscuring column, together with isothermal hydrostatic stratification, indicates that configurations reaching $N\\_H \\ge 10^{24} - 10^{25}$ cm$^{-2}$ require densities for which radiative losses (cooling and/or diffusion) occur faster than the dynamical time, suggesting that a long-lived static hot atmosphere is unlikely (an ``Opacity Crisis'') and that rapid inflow or radiation-pressure-driven evolution is favored. Using $512^3$ pseudo-spectral Schr{\\\"o}dinger-Poisson simulations of idealized soliton mergers, we illustrate that compact, high- density soliton cores can form via violent relaxation under representative scalings.

      "abstract": "{The JWST discovery of ``Little Red Dots'' (LRDs) has revealed a population of compact, red sources at $z \\sim 5-10$ that likely host supermassive black holes (SMBHs). Recent observations of the gravitationally lensed LRD R2211-RX1 reveal century-scale photometric variability and a hysteresis loop in the luminosity- temperature plane, strongly suggesting that the optical emission originates from a pulsating, stellar-like photosphere rather than an accretion disk. This supports the ``quasi-star'' hypothesis, where a rapidly growing black hole seed is embedded within a massive, radiation-pressure supported envelope. In this work, we investigate the stability of these envelopes using the stellar evolution code MESA coupled with the non-adiabatic oscillation code GYRE. We identify a theoretical ``Quasi-Star Instability Strip'' with a blue edge at $T\\_{\\mathrm{eff}} \\approx 5000-5200$ K. Models hotter than this threshold are stable, consistent with the non-variable LRD R2211-RX2 ($T\\_{\\mathrm{eff}} \\approx 5000$ K), while cooler models are unstable to radial pulsations driven by the $κ$-mechanism in helium and hydrogen ionization zones. For quasi-star masses in the range $M\\_\\star \\sim 10^4-10^5 M\\_\\odot$, we find that the unstable fundamental radial modes ($\\ell =0$, n$\\_{\\rm p}=1$) have periods in the range $\\sim 20-180$ years. The first overtone ($\\ell =0$, n$\\_{\\rm p}=2$) is also unstable or marginally stable in some of our models, with typical pulsation timescales $\\sim 10-30$ years. These oscillations match the co- moving frame variability timescale of RX1. We argue that these violent pulsations likely drive enhanced mass loss analogous to super-AGB winds, which could affect the duration of the quasi- star phase and regulate the final mass of the seeded black hole.}",

We show that models of late-stage quasi- stars, with BH masses exceeding {\\ensuremath{\\sim}}10\\% of the total, predict thermal and radiative properties that are insensitive to both BH and envelope mass and spectrally resemble LRDs.

The first star formation in the Universe occurs in dense clusters, some of which may undergo runaway collapse and form an intermediate mass black hole. This process would appear as a very dense stellar system, with recurring tidal disruption events (TDEs) as stellar material is accreted by the black hole. Such a system would be compact, UV-emitting, and exhibit broad H{\\ensuremath{\\alpha}} emission. If runaway collapse is the primary mechanism for forming massive black hole seeds, this process could be fairly common and explain the large volume densities of LRDs. In order to match the predicted number density of runaway collapse clusters, the tidal disruption rate must be on the order of 10$^{‑4}$ per year. A top-heavy stellar initial mass function may be required to match observations without exceeding the predicted {\\ensuremath{\\Lambda}}CDM mass function.

The LRDs appearing as ``Chimeras'' like both active galactic nuclei (AGNs) and galaxies have stimulated renewed interest in the roadmap of central massive black hole (cMBH) formation in AGNs. In this paper, we suggest that the LRDs contain $M\\_{\\bullet}\\lesssim 10^6\\,M\\_{\\odot}$ cMBHs as demonstrated by the So{\\l}tan argument and there is a large population of stellar-mass black holes (sMBHs with total mass of $\\mathscr{M}\\_{m\\_{\\bullet}}$) embedded inside cMBH accretion disks (cMBH-disk) as motivated by anomalous reverberations of broad H$β$ line in local AGNs. This embryo structure of LRDs ($M\\_{\\bullet}<\\mathscr{M}\\_{m\\_{\\bullet}}$) is formed as a consequence of gravitational collapse of primordial clouds. In this Chimera, accretion onto sMBHs powers the rest- frame optical continuum of the LRDs but the UV continuum is jointly contributed by slim parts of the cMBH-disks and nuclear starbursts in the core of collapsing clouds governing the appearance of the observed V-shaped spectral energy distributions (SEDs). Outflowing clumped-envelopes are unavoidably formed by radiation pressure leading to absorption features of the Balmer lines. The present model works very well for LRDs' SEDs and avoids the issues of overly massive cMBHs. Evolution of LRDs is briefly discussed including gravitational waves.}",

We present a theoretical model in which the LRDs descend from dark matter halos in the extreme low-spin tail of the angular momentum distribution. Within this framework, we explain their three key observational signatures: (i) abundance, (ii) compactness, and (iii) redshift distribution. Our model focuses on observed, not modeled, properties; it is thus independent of whether they are powered primarily by a black hole or stars. We find that the assumption that the prototypical LRD at z {\\ensuremath{\\sim}} 5 originates from halos in the lowest {\\ensuremath{\\sim}}1\\% of the spin distribution is sufficient to reproduce both their observed number densities and physical sizes. The redshift evolution of their observability is driven by the interplay between the evolving compact disk fraction and cosmological surface brightness dimming. This effect leads to a well-defined ``LRD era'' at 4 < z < 8, during which the LRDs are common and detectable; at z < 4, they are bright but rare, while at z > 8, they are common but faint. Finally, we test the predicted redshift trend against observational data, finding excellent agreement. Additional observational support comes from their excess small-scale clustering and spectral signatures of extreme core densities, both of which are expected outcomes of galaxy formation in low-spin halos. These findings suggest that the LRDs are not a fundamentally distinct population but the natural manifestation of galaxies forming in the rarest, lowest angular momentum environments.}",

We propose that LRDs form naturally after feedback-free starbursts (FFB) in thousands of star clusters and following wet compaction. Analytically, we show how the clusters enable efficient dry migration of stars and BHs to the galaxy center by two-body segregation and dynamical friction against the disk. The clusters merge to form compact central clusters as observed. Mutual tidal stripping does not qualitatively affect the analysis. The young, rotating clusters are natural sites for the formation of BH seeds via rapid core collapse. The migrating clusters carry the BH seeds, which merge into central super-massive BHs (SMBHs). Compactions are required to deepen the potential wells such that the SMBHs are retained after post-merger gravitational-wave recoils, locked to the galaxy centers. Using cosmological simulations at different epochs, with different codes and physical recipes, we evaluate the additional growth of LRD-matching compact central stellar systems by global compaction events. Adding to the dry growth by cluster mergers, the compactions can increase the escape velocities to retain the SMBHs. The LRDs appear at $z \\!\\sim\\! 8$, after the formation of FFB clusters, and disappear after $z \\!\\sim\\! 4$ when the stellar mass is above $10^9 M\\_\\odot$ by growing post-compaction blue disks around the nuclear LRDs.

A critical question remains: if LRDs were common at high redshifts, how would they evolve into local elliptical galaxies with significantly lower central densities? To address this, we performed direct N-body simulations of LRD mergers, focusing on the coevolution of host galaxies and central SMBHs. We track the complete evolution of SMBH binaries into the three-body hardening and gravitational-wave (GW) emission phase. Our results demonstrate that during galaxy mergers, the central SMBHs can eject a substantial amount of mass from the galactic core via the three-body slingshot effect, leading to a decrease in central stellar surface density by an order of magnitude. Additionally, GW recoil can further contribute in making the galaxy centers less dense and more in alignment with low-redshift quiescent galaxies. This transformation occurs on a relatively short timescale of a few {\\ensuremath{\\sim}}100 Myr, implying that LRDs can evolve into lower-redshift elliptical galaxies by z < 4. The timescales for our SMBH mergers vary between 100 and 800 Myr, depending on the initial orbital parameters of the merging galaxies and the mass ratio of the SMBHs. Our findings provide a plausible mechanism for the transformation of LRDs into elliptical galaxies while highlighting the efficiency of SMBH mergers in such high-density environments, which plays a crucial role in SMBH growth.}",

We first show that the direct formation of these BH masses in the early Universe is excluded by stringent CMB $μ$-distortion limits. We then investigate the assembly of massive BHs from lighter, observationally allowed primordial black holes (PBHs) via hierarchical mergers, finding that, although this channel can operate depending on the merger history, it faces challenges in explaining the observations due to the rarity of the required high-redshift dark matter halos. Finally, we estimate gas accretion onto intermediate-mass PBHs, while jointly tracking metallicity evolution, and identify regions of parameter space in which such growth could reproduce the observed properties of LRDs. As a special case, we focus on the strongly lensed source QSO1, whose extremely low metallicity and large mass provide a stringent test of these formation channels.}",

      "abstract": "{The recent discovery of little red dots - a population of extremely compact and highly dust-reddened high redshift galaxies - by the James Webb Space Telescope presents a new challenge to the fields of astrophysics and cosmology. Their remarkably high luminosities at redshifts 5 < z < 10, appear to challenge LambdaCDM cosmology and galaxy formation models, as they imply stellar masses and star formation rates that exceed the upper limits set by these models. LRDs are currently subjects of debate as the mechanisms behind their high luminosities are not yet fully understood. LRD energy outputs are thought to be either dominated by star formation or their energy output results from the hosting of active galactic nuclei. We investigate the starburst hypothesis by attempting to replicate the stellar properties of LRDs using output data from the FLARES simulation suite. Comparative analysis of galactic properties such as galactic number density, stellar mass and star formation rate yield significant tension between simulated and observed galaxies. The FLARES simulation overestimates the number densities of galaxies with stellar masses similar to observed LRDs by several orders of magnitude. Additionally, the simulation shows an overestimation of star formation rates. These tensions suggest a potential underestimation by the FLARES model of stellar feedback mechanisms such as active galactic nuclei feedback. These results suggest that the starburst hypothesis may be insufficient to explain the observed properties of these galaxies. Instead, the AGN scenario should be further investigated by repeating the methods in this study with a hydrodynamic galaxy simulation suite that models a higher influence of AGN feedback mechanisms on stellar activity in high redshift galaxies.}",

      "abstract": "{JWST observations have uncovered a new population of red, compact objects at high redshifts dubbed ``little red dots'' (LRDs), which typically show broad emission lines and are thought to be dusty active galactic nuclei (AGNs). Some of their other features, however, challenge the AGN explanation, such as prominent Balmer breaks and extremely faint or even missing metal high-ionization lines, X-ray, or radio emission, including in deep stacks. Time variability is another robust test of AGN activity. Here, we exploit the z = 7.045 multiply imaged LRD A2744-QSO1, which offers a particularly unique test of variability due to lensing-induced time delays between the three images spanning 22 yr (2.7 yr in the rest-frame), to investigate its photometric and spectroscopic variability. We find the equivalent widths (EWs) of the broad H{\\ensuremath{\\alpha}} and H{\\ensuremath{\\beta}} lines, which are independent of magnification and other systematics, to exhibit significant variations, of up to 18 {\\ensuremath{\\pm}} 3\\% for H{\\ensuremath{\\alpha}} and up to 22 {\\ensuremath{\\pm}} 8\\% in H{\\ensuremath{\\beta}}, on a timescale of 875 d (2.4 yr) in the rest-frame. This suggests that A2744-QSO1 is indeed an AGN. We find no significant photometric variability beyond the limiting systematic uncertainties, so it currently cannot be determined whether the EW variations are due to line-flux or continuum variability. These results are consistent with a typical damped random walk variability model for an AGN such as A2744-QSO1 (M$\\_{BH}$ = 4 {\\texttimes} {}10$^{7}$ M$\\_{{\\ensuremath{\\odot}}}$) given the sparse sampling of the light curve with the available data. Our results therefore support the AGN interpretation of this LRD, and highlight the need for further photometric and spectroscopic monitoring in order to build a detailed and reliable light curve.}",

      "abstract": "{To investigate the physical origin of the Balmer decrement in the broad- line region of active galactic nuclei (AGNs), we measure the temporal variability of the fluxes of the broad H{\\ensuremath{\\beta}} and H{\\ensuremath{\\alpha}} emission lines using multiepoch spectroscopic data of low-redshift AGNs from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. The analysis of the mean spectra reveals that the Balmer decrement shows no correlation with AGN luminosity, while it is inversely correlated with the Eddington ratio. However, the temporal variation of the Balmer decrement in individual objects exhibits an even stronger anticorrelation with AGN luminosity, suggesting that the change in AGN luminosity plays a dominant role in determining the Balmer decrement. By comparing the temporal evolution of the Balmer decrement with the continuum color, we find that reddening due to the AGN itself may not be the primary factor. Instead, radiative transfer effects and excitation mechanisms, which deviate from the Case B recombination, appear to be critical for the variation of the Balmer decrement. These results provide useful insights into the underlying physics of changing-look AGNs and high-z AGNs, such as the ``little red dots,'' which exhibit extreme values of the Balmer decrement that can be misinterpreted as evidence for dust.}",

      "abstract": "{Green Pea galaxies are a class of compact, low-mass, low-metallicity star-forming galaxies in the relatively local Universe. They are believed to be analogs of high-redshift galaxies that reionized the Universe, and, indeed, the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is now uncovering such populations at record redshifts. Intriguingly, JWST finds evidence suggestive of active galactic nuclei (AGN) in many of these distant galaxies, including the elusive Little Red Dots, which broadly lack any detectable X-ray counterparts. Intuitively, one would expect to detect an AGN in their low-redshift analogs with X-rays, yet no study to date has conclusively identified an X-ray AGN within a Green Pea galaxy. Here we present the deepest X-ray campaign of a Green Pea galaxy performed to date, obtained with the goal of discerning the presence of a (potentially low-luminosity) AGN. The target{\\textemdash}SDSS J082247.66+224144.0 (hereafter J0822+2241){\\textemdash}was previously found to display a comparable X-ray spectral shape to more local AGN ({\\ensuremath{\\Gamma}} {\\ensuremath{\\sim}} 2) and a high luminosity (L$\\_{2‑10 keV}$ {\\ensuremath{\\sim}} {}10$^{42}$ erg s$^{‑1}$). We show that over 6.2 yr (rest frame) the 2{\\textendash}10 keV luminosity of J0822+2241 is constant, whereas the soft 0.5{\\textendash}2 keV flux has decreased significantly by {\\ensuremath{\\sim}}60\\%. We discuss possible scenarios to explain the X-ray properties of J0822+2241, finding transient low column density obscuration surrounding an AGN to be the only plausible scenario. J0822+2241 thus provides further evidence that low-luminosity AGN activity could have contributed to the epoch of reionization and that local analogs are useful to derive a complete multiwavelength picture of black hole growth in high-redshift, low-luminosity AGNs. *Based on observations obtained with XMM-Newton, an ESA science mission with instruments and contributions directly funded by ESA Member States and NASA.}",

We present a study of CIII] emission in galaxies at z=5-7, using publicly available JWST/NIRSpec prism data from programs including CEERS, JADES, RUBIES and CAPERS. We built a sample of 61 CIII]-emitting galaxies, and we classified them as star-forming or active galactic nuclei (AGN) host galaxies using (1) rest-frame UV and optical emission-line diagnostic diagrams, and (2) the presence/absence of broad Balmer emission lines. The UV diagnostics are based on the combination of the rest-frame equivalent width (EW) of CIII] versus CIII]/HeII $λ$1640, and the EW of CIV versus CIV/HeII $λ$1640. For optical diagnostics, we employ the OHNO diagram, which combines [OIII] $λ$5007, H$β$, [NeIII] $λ$3869, and [OII] $λλ$3727,3729- and we find it has a low efficiency on separating AGN from SFG. We find that half of the sources in our sample (29 out of 61 galaxies) exhibit at least one secure indication of AGN activity while 13 are potential AGNs based on the CIII] diagnostic. Physical properties, including stellar mass and star formation rate, are derived through spectral energy distribution modeling with Bagpipes. Our analysis reveals that JWST is uncovering a population of strong CIII] emitters at high redshift (5<z<7) with a median EW of 22.8 A. This EW is higher than that of a control sample of CIII] emitters at redshift 3<z<4 with a median EW of 4.7 A. We find that for the same range of Muv, the CIII] EW increases by $\\sim$0.67 dex from 3<z<4 to 5<z<7, indicating strong redshift evolution in the line's strength.

Given their extreme red colouring in the observed frame these galaxies have been dubbed Little Red Dots (LRDs). The aim of this project was to identify LRDs using photometric data from previously uninvestigated JWST datasets and to estimate their AGN fractions by fitting the spectral energy distribution of each galaxy against well calibrated templates using CIGALE. We identified a list of potential LRDs using a single colour cut of F444W-F277W $>$1.5 mag and by applying a morphological analysis. We used EAZY to estimate the (photometric) redshift and CIGALE to estimate the AGN fraction of each LRD. Overall, we identified 14 LRDs, applying accurate SED fits to 11 of them. We found that 7 of them had a high AGN fraction (with the AGN component generating more than 50\\textbackslash\\% of the observed flux), a further two LRDs had AGN contribution in excess of approximately 40\\textbackslash\\%. In total nine LRDs (our of 14) are likely to have a supermassive black hole in their centre. Interestingly, the three LRDs which could not be well fit by CIGALE displayed extremely high photometric redshifts ($z\\_{phot} rsim 11$) and require further analysis (and may also host a supermassive black hole in their centre).}",

Recent JWST observations reveal an unexpectedly abundant population of overmassive black holes at z>4-6, where the BH masses lie far above local scaling relations and not reproduced by current cosmological models. How such overmassive black holes form and rapidly grow within young galaxies has remained unclear. Here we present fully cosmological radiation-hydrodynamic simulations that, for the first time, self-consistently follow the birth, early growth, and emergent observable signatures of SMBHs in proto-cluster environments. We find that heavy seeds of order $10^6 M\\_\\text{sun}$ naturally form, exceeding typical theoretical expectations by an order of magnitude. These seeds rapidly develop dense, optically thick disks whose strong electron scattering produces broad H$α$ emission comparable to that seen in little red dots (LRDs).

We employ Monte Carlo simulations to solve the Smoluchowski coagulation equation and determine the runaway merging timescale.

We present the results of SED analysis with multiwavelength photometric data and spectroscopic analysis, observed with Gemini-S/GMOS, FLAMINGOS-2, to explore the origin of blue-excess emission of a hyperluminous BlueDOG, ADFS-KMTDOG-102, at z = 2.6. The SED analysis shows that this BlueDOG is a highly massive system (log M$\\_{*}$/M$\\_{{\\ensuremath{\\odot}}}$ = 12.3) with substantial extinction. Additionally, the proportion of the old stellar population exceeds that of the young stellar population, which suggests stellar evolution cumulated from the early Universe. The mass of the supermassive black hole estimated using the extinction-corrected broad H{\\ensuremath{\\alpha}} emission line yields log M$\\_{BH}$/M$\\_{{\\ensuremath{\\odot}}}$ = 10.2. We discuss the similarity between the BlueDOG and ``Little Red Dots'' (LRDs), recently discovered with the James Webb Space Telescope, showing SED shapes remarkably similar to those of LRDs. The UV emission line ratios indicate that the emission lines are primarily powered by the central active galactic nuclei (AGN). In contrast, the origin of the blue-excess UV continuum remains ambiguous, since both recent star formation and AGN-induced scattered light are viable explanations, based on the results from the SED fitting and scattered light modeling.}",

The origin of both classes of objects remains uncertain but is likely linked to the formation and early growth of the first massive black holes (MBHs), which may be more easily explained by invoking phases of super-Eddington accretion. In this study, we used a state-of- the-art zoom-in cosmological simulation of a quasar host to investigate whether these objects could resemble any of the peculiar sources observed with JWST during their assembly. We find that the impact of MBH feedback on star formation is typically moderate, with outflows preferentially escaping perpendicular to the galactic disc. However, for approximately ten percent of the galaxy's lifetime, the system enters a distinct quenched phase following rapid MBH growth driven by super-Eddington accretion. This phase culminates in a powerful feedback event, during which the MBH jet and disc-driven winds interact directly with the galactic disc and carve out a central cavity. We also find that, during the history of the quasar host progenitor, the spectral properties of the system can resemble both LRDs and quenched galaxies, depending on the specific evolutionary stage considered. These findings suggest that both conditions may represent transient phases in the life cycle of high-redshift galaxies.}",

We argue that the answers to these puzzles may be linked to an interpretation of the data on the nanohertz gravitational waves (GWs) discovered by NANOGrav and other pulsar timing arrays as SMBH binaries whose evolution is driven by interactions with their environments down to O(0.1 pc) separations. We show that the stellar mass-black hole mass correlations found in JWST data and in low-ɀ inactive galaxies are similar, and present a global fit to these data, excluding low-ɀ AGNs. Matching the NANOGrav and dual-AGN data requires that binary evolution due to environmental effects at separations below O(1 kpc) be rapid on cosmological timescales. According to this interpretation, the SMBHs in low-ɀ AGNs are the tip of the iceberg of a local SMBH population in mainly inactive galaxies. This interpretation is consistent with the 'little red dots' observed with JWST being AGNs, and would favour the observability of GW signals from black hole binaries in LISA and decihertz GW detectors.}",

This system exhibits an extreme black- hole-to-stellar mass ratio and unusually low metallicity, posing significant challenges to BH seeding models. Motivated by these discoveries, we perform high-resolution cosmological simulations with a massive primordial black hole (PBH; $M\\_{\\rm BH}=5\\times10^7\\,M\\_\\odot$) seed, incorporating for the first time a fully coupled treatment of PBH accretion, BH feedback, and Population\\raisebox{-0.5ex}\\textasciitildeIII/II star formation and stellar feedback. Although PBHs accelerate structure formation through the seed effect, the associated strong thermal feedback from the accretion delays the onset of star formation to $z\\lesssim 10$, producing short, bursty episodes throughout the subsequent evolution. PBH-driven outflows expel enriched gas from the nucleus, while sustained inflows from the intergalactic medium continuously replenish pristine material. This feedback-regulated cycle naturally yields low accretion rates ($\\dot{m}\\_{\\rm BH}/\\dot{m}\\_{\\rm edd} \\sim 1-10\\%$), subsolar metallicities ($Z/Z\\_\\odot\\lesssim10^{-2}$) and extreme $M\\_{\\rm BH}/M\\_\\star$ ratios during both the initial star-forming phase and the subsequent quenching phases, in excellent agreement with JWST observations. Our results demonstrate that massive PBHs offer a viable pathway for forming the most extreme high-redshift systems, providing a physically motivated explanation for the extraordinary properties of Abell 2744-QSO1, as a sub-class of the broader population of JWST-discovered ``little red dots''.}",

      "title": "{Halo mergers enhance the growth of massive black hole seeds}",
      "abstract": "{Context. High-redshift observations of {}10$^{9}$ M$\\_{{\\ensuremath{\\odot}}}$ supermassive black holes (SMBHs) at z {\\ensuremath{\\sim}} 7 and 'little red dots' that may host over- massive black holes (BHs) at z > 4 suggests the existence of so- called heavy seeds (> 1000 M$\\_{{\\ensuremath{\\odot}}}$) in the early Universe. Recent work has suggested that the rapid assembly of halos may be the key to forming heavy seeds early enough in the Universe to match such observations, as the high rate of accretion into the halo suppresses the cooling ability of H$\\_{2}$, allowing it to quickly accrete up to the atomic cooling limit of {}10$^{7}$ M$\\_{{\\ensuremath{\\odot}}}$ prior to the run-away collapse of baryonic gas within its dark matter (DM) potential, without the need for extreme radiation fields or DM streaming velocities. Aims. While the rapid assembly of halos can lead to increased halo masses upon the onset of collapse, it remains unclear if this leads to higher-mass BH seeds. As a common route for halos to grow rapidly is via halo-halo mergers, we aim to test what effects such a merger occurring during the initial gas collapse has on the formation of BH seeds. Methods. We performed simulations of BH seed formation in four distinct idealised halo collapse scenarios: an isolated {}10$^{6}$ M$\\_{{\\ensuremath{\\odot}}}$ minihalo, an isolated {}10$^{7}$ M$\\_{{\\ensuremath{\\odot}}}$ atomic halo, the direct collision of two {}10$^{7}$ M$\\_{{\\ensuremath{\\odot}}}$ halos, and a fly-by collision of two {}10$^{7}$ M$\\_{{\\ensuremath{\\odot}}}$ halos. We simulated the collapse of the gas down to scales of {\\ensuremath{\\sim}}0.0075 pc before inserting sink particles as BH seeds and captured a further 10 Myr of accretion. Results. We have shown that halo collisions create a central environment of increased density, inside which BH seeds can accrete at higher rates. For direct collisions, the gas density peaks are disrupted by the interaction, as the collisionless DM peaks pass through each other while the colliding gas is left in the centre, removing the BH from its accretion source. When the central density peaks instead experience a fly-by interaction, the BH remains embedded in the dense gas and maintains higher accretion rates throughout the simulated period compared to the isolated halo cases. The total simulated period was 70 Myr, and we followed the evolution of the BH for the final 10 Myr. The BH spends the final 6 Myr embedded in the dense, shocked region. The final mass of the BH is a factor of 2 greater than in the isolated atomic halo case, and a factor of 3 greater than the minihalo case, reaching {}10$^{4}$ M$\\_{{\\ensuremath{\\odot}}}$ via its 0.03 pc accretion radius. As the maximum halo mass before collapse is determined by the atomic cooling limit of a few times {}10$^{7}$ M$\\_{{\\ensuremath{\\odot}}}$, the ability of halo-halo mergers to further boost the rates of accretion onto the central object may play a crucial role in growing SMBH seeds, which is needed to explain recent observations of seemingly over-massive BHs at high redshifts.}",

If they exist, an abundant population of compact objects known as cosmic string loops permeate the Universe at all times, providing a secondary source of density perturbations that are large amplitude and non-gaussian in nature. In general, these loops are not stationary in the rest frame of the dark matter, thus their relative velocities will typically seed both spherical and filamentary overdensities in the matter era. Building upon previous work, we provide an improved framework to compute the complete halo mass function for these string seeded overdensities, valid for any loop velocity distribution. Using this mass function, we also compute the subset of halos capable of undergoing a direct collapse, forming a population of black holes with initial mass $10^{4-5} \\, M\\_{\\odot}$ at high redshifts.

By fitting the observed masses and luminosities of J0313--1806 ($z=7.64$) and J0100+2802 ($z=6.30$) with Bayesian inference, we infer initial conditions that favor massive seed black holes with initial mass $M\\_0 \\sim 10^{6}\\,M\\_\\odot$, formed at $z\\sim20{-}30$ in environments with baryonic overdensity factors $f\\_ρrsim 50$ relative to the cosmic mean.

Gemini/Gemini Near- InfraRed Spectrograph and Keck/Low-Resolution Imaging Spectrometer observations confirm 23 to be type 2 QSOs at . Multiband photometry is used for SED fitting, covering 0.1─10 m in the rest frame. The IR emission is dominated by the dust torus, with an average luminosity of . We present three possibilities for the origin of the rest-ultraviolet/optical: scattered light, stellar emission, and the reddened accretion disc. Assuming an obscured:unobscured ratio of 1:1, the targets have bolometric luminosities of and supermassive black hole masses of , averaging and , assuming the Eddington limit. Compared to previous type 2 active galactic nuclei SEDs, our targets have a brighter dust torus and redder optical─IR colour. By comparing the SED to JWST 'little red dots' (LRDs), we find that these IR-selected type 2 QSOs have similar SED shapes to the LRDs. This survey demonstrates mid-IR selection as an efficient method to find luminous type 2 QSOs and the composite photometry generated by this sample provides a guide for finding more type 2 QSOs at higher redshift in the future.}",

While there is no correlation between galaxy age and local galaxy density, we find modest correlations of local galaxy density with increasing stellar mass, decreasing 10{\\textendash}100 Myr star formation rate ratios, and decreasing nebular line equivalent widths. We further find that the protocluster galaxies are consistent with being more massive, being older, and hosting higher star formation rates than the field sample at the 3{\\ensuremath{\\sigma}} level, distributed in a filamentary structure that supports inside-out formation of the protocluster. There is modest evidence that galaxy evolution proceeds differently as a function of the density of local environment within protoclusters during the epoch of reionization, and the central quasar has little effect on the galaxy properties of the surrounding structure.}",

One of the most important discoveries by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is the unexpected existence in the Early Universe (z > 4) of very large quantities of ``Little Red Dots'' (LRDs), compact luminous red galaxies of intriguing physical properties. Aims. We wish to know if LRDs may host accreting Intermediate/Supermassive Black Holes (IMBHs/SMBHs) that may power LRDs, and compare them with the effect of clusters of massive stars. The spectrum of radio emission (synchrotron vs thermal) can be used to know which between these two types of energy sources is the dominant one. Methods. So far LRDs at high redshifts have not been detected at radio wavelengths and it is not known why. Assuming this could be due to their large distances and/or present limitations of observational capabilities, we analyze here archive Very Large Array radio observations of two analog candidates of LRDs in the Local Universe (LLRDs) at redshifts z = 0.1 - 0.2. Results. The LLRD source J1047+0739 at z = 0.1682 is detected at 6.0 GHz in 2018 with the VLA-A of NRAO as a compact source with radii less than 0.2 arc sec (< 600 pc at d = 700 Mpc). Its flux density was 117$\\pm$8 $μ$Jy and its spectral index was -0.85, which is typical of optically-thin synchrotron emission. It is also detected at 5.0 GHz in 2010 with the VLA-C, showing a flux density of 43$\\pm$3 $μ$Jy. Conclusions. The observed flux densities can be provided by a radio luminous supernova. The increase in flux density over eight years can be explained as the result of two independent supernovae or as the radio re- brightening of a single one. Radio time monitoring of this and other LLRDs could help clarify the mystery of the radio silence of its cosmological counterparts.}",

Here we report a systematic search for nuclear variability among $\\sim 25\\,$k sources covered by NIRCam (F200W+F444W) imaging using the first two NEXUS epochs separated by 9 months in the observed frame. Difference imaging techniques reach $1σ$ variability sensitivity of 0.18\\raisebox{-0.5ex}\\textasciitildemag (F200W) and 0.15\\raisebox{-0.5ex}\\textasciitildemag (F444W) at 28th magnitude (within 0''.2 diameter aperture), improved to $0.01$\\raisebox{-0.5ex}\\textasciitildemag and $0.02$\\raisebox{-0.5ex}\\textasciitildemag at $<25$th magnitude, demonstrating the superb performance of NIRCam photometry. The difference imaging results represent significant improvement over aperture photometry on individual epochs (by $>30\\%$). We identify 465 high-confidence variable sources among the parent sample, with 2-epoch flux difference at $>3σ$ from the fiducial variability sensitivity. Essentially all these variable sources are of extragalactic origin based on preliminary photometric classifications, and follow a similar photometric redshift distribution as the parent sample up to $z\\_{\\rm phot}>10$. While the majority of these variability candidates are likely normal unobscured AGNs, some of them may be rare nuclear stellar transients and tidal disruption events that await confirmation with spectroscopy and continued photometric monitoring. We also constrain the photometric variability of ten spectroscopically confirmed broad-line Little Red Dots (LRDs) at $3\\lesssim z \\lesssim 7$, and find none of them show detectable variability in either band. We derive stringent $3σ$ upper limits on the F444W variability of $\\sim 3-10\\%$ for these LRDs, with a median value of $\\sim 5\\%$.

Here we propose a possible mechanism for forming such systems which hinges on the presence of primordial black holes (PBHs) covering a range of masses while contributing a significant fraction of the dark matter (DM). We evaluate the accurate expression for the small-scale power responsible for the collapse of the first halos in the presence of the PBH population. The extra power in the matter density field, produced by the granulation term, will cause an earlier collapse of DM halos, populated by PBHs of different masses. In these collapsed and virialized systems the PBHs will undergo 2-body relaxation, driving the more massive PBHs to the halo center under dynamical friction. We quantify this evolution for a distribution of PBH orbital parameters and halo properties. The analysis shows that PBHs can have appropriate mass functions capable of producing systems with parameters similar to what is observed for UHZ1. We suggest that the proposed mechanism could account for a subset of other systems newly discovered with the JWST at high redshifts, including the Little Red Dots.}",

This mechanism is particularly promising for explaining the abundance of the little red dots (LRDs){\\textemdash}early active galactic nuclei whose BHs appear dramatically overmassive relative to their host galaxies.

We present analysis of Balmer absorption in a sample of 14 iron low-ionization BAL quasars (FeLoBALQs); eight are new identifications. We measured velocity offset, width, and apparent optical depth. The partial covering that is ubiquitous in BAL quasar spectra alters the measured Balmer optical depth ratios; accounting for this, we estimated the true H(n = 2) column density. We found the anticipated correlation between Eddington ratio and outflow speed, but it is weak in this sample because nearly all of the objects have the low outflow speeds characterizing loitering outflow FeLoBAL quasars, objects that are also found to have low accretion rates. Measurements of dN/dv, the differential column density with respect to the outflow speed, are anticorrelated with the luminosity and Eddington ratio: the strongest absorption is observed at the lowest speeds in the lowest-luminosity objects. The absorption line width is correlated with {\\ensuremath{\\alpha}}$\\_{oi}$, the F$\\_{{\\ensuremath{\\lambda}}}$ point-to-point slope between 5100 {\\r{A}} and 3 {\\ensuremath{\\mu}}m. This parameter is strongly correlated with the Eddington ratio among low-redshift quasars. BALs have been recently found in the spectra of little red dots (LRDs), a class of high-redshift objects discovered by JWST. We note suggestive similarities between LRDs and FeLoBAL quasars in the emission-line shape, the presence of steep reddening and a scattered blue continuum, the lack of hot dust emission, and X-ray weakness.}",

In this study, we introduce Mephisto -- a multi-agent collaboration framework powered by large language models (LLMs) that emulates human-like reasoning for analyzing multi-band galaxy observations. Mephisto interfaces with the CIGALE codebase (a library of spectral energy distribution, SED, models) to iteratively refine physical models against observational data. It conducts deliberate reasoning via tree search, accumulates knowledge through self- play, and dynamically updates its knowledge base. Validated across diverse galaxy populations -- including the James Webb Space Telescope's recently discovered ``Little Red Dot'' galaxies -- we show that Mephisto demonstrates proficiency in inferring the physical properties of galaxies from multi-band photometry, positioning it as a promising research copilot for astronomers. Unlike prior black-box machine learning approaches in astronomy, Mephisto offers a transparent, human-aligned reasoning process that integrates seamlessly with existing research practices. This work underscores the possibility of LLM-driven agent-based research for astronomy, establishes a foundation for fully automated, end-to-end artificial intelligence (AI)-powered scientific workflows, and unlocks new avenues for AI-augmented discoveries in astronomy.}",

High-z M$\\_{BH}$ measurements are critical for probing growth histories of BHs and their host galaxies, including BH seeding and evolution of the M$\\_{BH}${\\textendash}M$\\_{{\\ensuremath{\\star}}}$ relation. However, BH masses in high-z AGN are generally estimated from single-epoch measurements, which carry large systematic uncertainties. More reliable M$\\_{BH}$ detection methods like dynamical measurements are currently only possible in the local Universe or with strongly lensed systems. Fortunately, new dynamical M$\\_{BH}$ measurements in a sample of six local galaxies identified as likely relics of common quiescent red nugget galaxies at cosmic noon, as well as a z {\\ensuremath{\\sim}} 2 lensed red nugget, present a complementary probe of high-z relations. We compare the z {\\ensuremath{\\sim}} 2 red nugget and relic BHs to recent results for 4 < z < 11 AGN, quasi-stellar objects, and little red dots. Intriguingly, the z {\\ensuremath{\\sim}} 2 galaxy and local relics all lie on both the local M$\\_{BH}${\\textendash}M$\\_{{\\ensuremath{\\star}}}$ relation for bulges and the 4 < z < 7 M$\\_{BH}${\\textendash}M$\\_{{\\ensuremath{\\star}}}$ AGN relation, although high-z AGN remain overmassive compared to both local relations.

This also efficiently produces a paired BH binary with {\\ensuremath{\\sim}}0.1 pc separation. The centrally concentrated stellar density profile (akin to a ``protobulge'') allows the cluster as a whole to capture and retain gas and build up a large (parsec-scale) circumbinary accretion disk with gas coherently funneled to the central BH (even when the BH radius of influence is small). The disk is ``hypermagnetized'' and ``flux-frozen'': dominated by a toroidal magnetic field with plasma {\\ensuremath{\\beta}} {\\ensuremath{\\sim}} 10$^{‑3}$, with the fields amplified by flux-freezing.

Our analysis demonstrates that SEDs with red optical and blue UV continua are very common in HRQs, with >82percnt of the sample showing a UV-excess relative to the reddened quasar continuum. We model the SEDs by combining a reddened quasar and an unobscured scattered light component, though contributions from a star-forming host galaxy cannot be ruled out. The average scattering fraction is small (\\raisebox{-0.5ex}\\textasciitilde0.3percnt). Higher scattering fractions are ruled out by the (i - K) > 2.5 colour-cut used to select HRQs which pre-dates the discovery of the JWST ``Little Red Dot'' (LRD) population. Hence, LRDs generally have bluer UV continua. Nevertheless, four HRQs satisfy the LRD UV/optical continuum slope selections and are therefore massive, cosmic noon analogues of LRDs. Analysis of the near-infrared SEDs of HRQs reveals a deficit of hot dust relative to blue quasars, similar to what is observed in LRDs. This suggests HRQs trace a phase where strong AGN feedback processes eject dust from the inner torus. The UV scattering fraction of HRQs is weakly correlated with the amount of hot dust emission and anti- correlated with the line-of-sight extinction, . This is consistent with the hot dust acting as the scattering medium, and the line-of-sight extinction being dominated by dust on interstellar medium scales in the host galaxy.}",

Using orbit-based dynamical models, we model Segue 1, including a dark halo and a central black hole. The best-fit model requires a black hole mass of 4.5 {\\ensuremath{\\pm}} 1.5 {\\texttimes} {}10$^{5}$ M$\\_{{\\ensuremath{\\odot}}}$. The value of the black hole mass is similar either with or without a dark halo. The mass-to-light ratio of the stars is poorly constrained by the dynamical modeling, reflecting that Segue 1 is dominated by mass other than stars. Dynamical models that exclude a black hole provide a worse fit and require a dark halo with very-small-scale radii of below 100 pc. Additionally, the zero black hole models require a stellar orbital distribution that is highly radially biased. The model with a black hole provides an orbital structure that is close to isotropic, more similar to other well-studied systems. We argue that the two-parameter models of stars and black hole provide a better description of Segue 1 than the three-parameter models of stars and two dark halo components. Additional support for a central black hole comes from a significant increase in the central rotation. Using individual velocities, we measure a rotation amplitude of 9.0 {\\ensuremath{\\pm}} 2.4 km s$^{‑1}$.

      "abstract": "{The dwarf spheroidal galaxy, Segue 1, is thought to have one of the largest ratios of dark matter to stellar mass. Using orbit-based dynamical models, we model Segue 1, including a dark halo and a central black hole. The best-fit model requires a black hole mass of $4 \\pm 1.5 \\times 10^5\\ M\\_\\odot$. The value of the black hole mass is the same with or without a dark halo. The mass-to- light ratio of the stars is poorly constrained by the dynamical modeling, reflecting that Segue 1 is dominated by mass other than stars. Dynamical models that exclude a black hole provide a worse fit and require a dark halo with very small scale radii of around 100 parsecs. Additionally, the zero black hole models require a stellar orbital distribution that is highly radially biased. The model with a black hole provides an orbital structure that is close to isotropic, more similar to other well-studied systems. We argue that the two-parameter models of stars and black hole provide a better description of Segue 1 than the three-parameter models of stars and two dark halo components. Additional support for a central black hole comes from a significant increase in the central rotation. Using individual velocities, we measure a rotation amplitude of $9.0 \\pm 2.4\\ \\mathrm{km\\ s^{-1}}$. Segue 1 is likely being tidally stripped at large radii, and we might be witnessing the remnant nucleus of a more massive system. Alternatively, given the high black hole mass relative to the stellar mass, Segue 1 is analogous to Little Red Dots seen in the early Universe.}",

By performing and analysing cosmological hydrodynamical simulations of $(50 \\textasciitilde\\ {\\rm Mpc})^3$ comoving boxes, we also study how the BH feedback parameters affect the coevolution between SMBHs and their host galaxies. Starting as $10^5 M\\_{\\odot}$ seeds, we find that the BHs grow initially via BH mergers to $\\sim 10^7 M\\_{\\odot}$. Gas accretion onto the BHs is initially low, then increases with time, and reaches the Eddington rate after $7-9$ Gyrs. The BHs then undergo very fast growth via efficient gas accretion over a period of $600 - 700$ Myr, when the BH mass increases $10^2 - 10^3$ times, causing their predominant growth from $10^7 M\\_{\\odot}$ to $(10^9 - 10^{10}) M\\_{\\odot}$. Taking into account the cosmological gas inflows and outflows, SMBHs do not grow to more than $10^{10} M\\_{\\odot}$ by $z=0$, because of gas depletion from galaxy centers driven by AGN feedback. In terms of SMBH - host galaxy coevolution along the $M\\_{\\rm BH} - M\\_{\\star}$ relation, we find that they initially lie below and thereby move upward toward the relation. We make some physical implications of the growth of high-$z$ Little Red Dots recently observed by JWST: the normal-mass SMBHs had predominantly undergone BH merger driven evolution, whereas the overmassive BHs underwent periods of Eddington-limited or super-Eddington bursts of gas accretion.}",

The origin of this excess is still under debate, although several possibilities have been presented. We propose that gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are a powerful probe to explore the origin of the excess and, hence, the star and galaxy formation histories in the early universe. Focusing on the recently launched mission, Einstein Probe (EP), we find that EP can detect several GRBs annually at z {\\ensuremath{\\gtrsim}} 10, assuming the GRB formation rate calibrated by events at z {\\ensuremath{\\lesssim}} 6 can be extrapolated. Interestingly, depending on the excess scenarios, the GRB event rate may also show an excess at z ≃ 10, and its detection will help to discriminate between the scenarios that are otherwise difficult to distinguish. Additionally, we discuss that the puzzling, red-color, compact galaxies discovered by JWST, the so-called ``little red dots,'' could host dark GRBs if they are dust-obscured star-forming galaxies.

      "abstract": "{We present a theoretical framework for seeding and growing supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in dark-matter halos along their assembly histories. Seeds are bred out of Pop-III stars formed during the first collapse of pristine gas in mini-halos that have reached the ${\\rm H}\\_2$-cooling limit, modulated by UV radiation from star formation and dynamical heating from fast halo assembly. Such breeding persists until the enrichment of the intergalactic medium (IGM) enables Pop-II stars to form. Post-seeding growth of black holes (BHs) is driven by distinct channels, starting with episodic super-Eddington accretion associated with nuclear bursts induced by global disturbances of galaxies, followed by sustained sub-Eddington accretion via capturing sub-clouds formed in self-gravitating gas clouds (SGCs) in halos of fast assembly, and ending with merger-dominated, quiescent growth. We implement the model in subhalo merger trees to build a coherent framework to follow the SMBH-galaxy-halo co-evolution over their full lives in the full structure hierarchy. BH seeds are bred with a broad mass spectrum of $M\\_{\\rm BH} = 10$--$10^5\\,{\\rm M}\\_\\odot$ at $z \\approx 20$--$30$ in mini-halos with masses of $10^5$--$10^8\\,{\\rm M}\\_\\odot$. Nuclear bursts provide the key condition for seeds to grow into SMBHs. The $M\\_{\\rm BH}$-$M\\_*$ relation is a multi-piece, redshift-dependent function shaped by the interplay among different growth channels. Our model predictions are broadly consistent with existing observations; especially, a population of BHs reminiscent of `little red dots' (LRDs) discovered by JWST naturally results from the seeding and growing processes.

This black- hole-envelope configuration facilitates efficient photohadronic interactions and neutrino production.

We consider that relativistic jets and outflows are launched from the black hole and propagate through low-density polar funnels within envelopes, where particle acceleration and neutrino emission occur.

      "abstract": "{We present a comprehensive analysis of super-Eddington black hole accretion simulations that solve the GRMHD equations coupled with angle-discretized radiation transport. The simulations span a range of accretion rates, two black hole spins, and two magnetic field topologies, and include resolution studies as well as comparisons with non-radiative models. Super-Eddington accretion flows consistently develop geometrically thick disks supported by radiation pressure, regardless of magnetic field configuration. Radiation generated in the inner disk drives substantial outflows, forming conical funnel regions that limit photon escape and result in very low radiation efficiency. The accretion flows are highly turbulent with thermal energy transport dominated by radiation advection rather than diffusion. Angular momentum is primarily carried outward by Maxwell stress, with turbulent Reynolds stress playing a subdominant role. Both strong and weak jets are produced. Strong jets arise from sufficient net vertical magnetic flux and rapid black hole spin and can effectively evacuate the funnel, enabling radiation to escape through strong geometric beaming. In contrast, weak jets fail to clear the funnel, which becomes obscured by radiation-driven outflows and leads to distinct observational signatures. Spiral structures are observed in the plunging region, behaving like density waves. These super- Eddington models are applicable to a variety of astronomical systems, including ultraluminous X-ray sources, little red dots, and black hole transients.}",

These models apply an algorithm targeting direct solutions to the radiation transport equation in full general relativity and have been enabled by access to modern exascale computing systems. Super-Eddington accretion flows form geometrically thick radiation-pressure-supported disks that drive powerful equatorial outflows. A narrow funnel-shaped photosphere in the inner region results in very low radiative efficiencies in this regime. The structure of near- and sub- Eddington accretion depends on whether there is net vertical magnetic flux at the midplane of the disk. With net flux, the disk forms a thin, dense layer at the midplane surrounded by a magnetically dominated corona, whereas without net flux, the disk remains magnetically dominated everywhere. Although none of our models achieve the magnetically arrested disk regime, those with net vertical flux and a rapidly spinning black hole still produce powerful relativistic jets. Our calculations adopt simple opacity models (with scalings appropriate to stellar-mass black hole accretion). We discuss the application of our results to observations of X-ray binaries and ultraluminous X-ray sources such as Cyg X-3 and SS433. We also speculate on the application of our super-Eddington models to the interpretation of little red dots recently discovered by JWST.}",

      "abstract": "{The dust content of star-forming galaxies is generally positively correlated with their stellar mass. However, some recent JWST studies have shown the existence of a population of dwarf galaxies with an unexpectedly large dust attenuation. Using the Cosmic Evolution Early Release Science Survey (CEERS) data, we identified a sample of 1361 highly extincted low-mass (HELM) galaxies, defined as dwarf galaxies ($M\\_*<10^{8.5}$) with Av>1mag or more massive galaxies with an exceptionally high dust attenuation given their stellar mass (i.e., $Av>1.6log\\_{10}(M\\_*/Mo)-12.6$). The selection is performed using the multiparameter distribution obtained through a comprehensive spectral energy distribution fitting analysis, based on optical to near-infrared data. After excluding possible contaminants, like brown dwarfs, little red dots, high-z (z>8.5) and ultra- high-z (z>15) galaxies, the sample mainly includes sources at z<1, with a tail extending up to z=7.2. The sample has a median stellar mass of $10^7$ Mo and a median dust attenuation of Av=2mag. We analysed the morphology, environment and star- formation rate of these sources to investigate the reason of their large dust attenuation. In particular, HELM sources have sizes (effective radii, Re) similar to non-dusty dwarf galaxies and no correlation is visible between the axis ratios (b/a) and the dust attenuation. This findings indicate that it is unlikely that the large dust attenuation is due to projection effects, but a prolate or a disk-on oblate geometry are still possible, at least for a subsample of the sources. We have found that the distribution of HELM sources is slightly skewed toward more clustered environments than non-dusty dwarfs and tend to be slightly less star forming. This finding, if confirmed by spectroscopic follow-up, indicates that HELM sources could be going through some environmental processes, such as galaxy interactions.}",

Among them is the UHZ1 system at , containing in stars, with a similarly massive central black hole of . Here we propose a possible mechanism for forming such systems which hinges on the presence of primordial black holes (PBHs) covering a range of masses while contributing a significant fraction of the dark matter (DM). We evaluate the accurate expression for the small-scale power responsible for the collapse of the first haloes in the presence of the PBH population. The extra power in the matter density field, produced by the granulation term, will cause an earlier collapse of DM haloes, populated by PBHs of different masses. In these collapsed and virialized systems the PBHs will undergo 2-body relaxation, driving the more massive PBHs to the halo centre under dynamical friction. We quantify this evolution for a distribution of PBH orbital parameters and halo properties. The analysis shows that PBHs can have appropriate mass functions capable of producing systems with parameters similar to what is observed for UHZ1. We suggest that the proposed mechanism could account for a subset of other systems newly discovered with the James Webbn Space Telescope (JWST) at high redshifts, including the Little Red Dots.}",

As likely descendants of the red nugget population, cEGs offer a unique window into the early Universe, enabling the study of early galaxy evolution and the interplay between black holes, stellar bulges, and dark matter halos. Using data from Chandra and XMM-Newton, we investigate the properties of the hot gaseous halos in cEGs. Two galaxies ─ MRK 1216 and PGC 32873 ─ host luminous, spatially extended X-ray atmospheres, allowing us to derive radial thermodynamic profiles. For MRK 1216, we performed high-resolution spectral modeling with RGS data, which hints at super-solar {\\ensuremath{\\alpha}}/Fe abundance ratios. The remaining galaxies show either faint or undetected X-ray halos, though several display AGN-like (active galactic nucleus) power-law emission. In the context of local scaling relations, cEGs show only mild deviations from the general galaxy population, exhibiting a slightly steeper M$\\_{★}$ {\\ensuremath{-}} L$\\_{X}$ relation and occupying the lower boundary of the M$\\_{★}$─M$\\_{vir}$ relation. These trends suggest that high- redshift red nuggets may also host a diverse range of X-ray atmospheres.

We apply this method to emission line sources without significant contamination and select 19 QSO candidates at redshift <inline-formula><tex-math id=``TM0006'' notation=``LaTeX''>$z=0.12\\!-\\!1.56$</tex-math></inline- formula>. 12 of these candidates have Chandra X-ray detections. This sample covers a broader range of the rest-frame UV colours and has redder optical slopes compared to the SDSS QSOs, yet it is likely to be composed of normal QSOs rather than little red dots. Through spectral analysis, the estimated black hole masses of the sample are <inline-formula><tex-math id=``TM0007'' notation=``LaTeX''>$10^{6.9}\\!-\\!10^{8.3} \\,{\\rm M}\\_{\\odot }$</tex-math></inline-formula>. Our new candidates improve the completeness of the QSO sample at <inline-formula><tex-math id=``TM0008'' notation=``LaTeX''>$z=0.8\\!-\\!1.6$</tex- math></inline-formula> in the 3D-HST field. The proposed method will also be helpful for QSO selections via slitless spectroscopy in Euclid and the Chinese Space Station Telescope.}",

We use the ultra-deep data to identify new counterimages for previously confirmed (spectroscopically) lensed systems. We use the full set of spectroscopically confirmed systems to derive a new lens model, which is later used to confirm many of the previous lensed system candidates and discover new lensed system candidates in the images. We compute the geometric redshifts, time delays, and magnification for all counterimages (confirmed and not confirmed). Among the new systems we find a peculiar multiply lensed galaxy with a strong emission line at $\\approx 4\\, μ$m that likely corresponds to H$-β$ and/or OIII at $z\\approx 7.5$. This galaxy could be a little-red-dot or an extreme emission line galaxy. We also identify a yellow supergiant lensed star candidate at $z\\approx 3.1$. This star shows some similarities with previous Kaiju stars and we nickname it ``Hedorah'', in honor of the famous yellow-eyed Kaiju. Previous lensed stars at $z>0.1$ are either blue supergiants or red supergiants, making Hedorah the first yellow supergiant discovered beyond $z=0.1$ and confirming that, despite their rarity, they can also be found at these redshifts. Since many Cepheid stars are yellow supergiants, we consider the possibility that Hedorah could also be the first Cepheid discovered at cosmological distances, but we conclude that Hedorah is more likely a hypergiant yellow star approaching the end of its life. Alternatively, Hedorah could be a small group of stars, although this is less likely based on Hedorah's peculiar colors and additionally may require the more exotic fuzzy dark matter to help explain the lack of counterimage.}",

These UDGs display blue pseudobulges with S{\\'e}rsic indices n < 2.5 and effective radii spanning 300{\\textendash}700 pc, along with bluer thin stellar disks exhibiting low surface brightness and expansive effective radii that align with the UDG definition. The rotation velocities of these UDGs, determined using H I line widths and optical inclinations, exceed those of most dwarf galaxies of similar mass, suggesting the high halo spins or substantial dark matter halos. We propose that these UDGs likely formed through mergers of dwarf galaxies lacking old stars in their progenitors, resulting in the development of central bulge-like structures during starbursts triggered by the mergers while also enhancing their halo spin. Subsequent gas accretion facilitated the formation of extended stellar disks. It is also worth noting the possibility that these UDGs could alternatively represent ``failed L$^{{\\ensuremath{\\star}}}$ galaxies'' with massive dark matter halos but reduced star formation efficiencies. If future high-resolution H I observations confirm the presence of massive halos around these UDGs, they may have formed due to intense AGN feedback in the early Universe and may be the descendants of ``little red dots'' observed by the James Webb Space Telescope, which are characterized by heightened central black hole masses and intensified accretion and feedback processes in the early Universe.}",
