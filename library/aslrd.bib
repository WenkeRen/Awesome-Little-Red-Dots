This survey demonstrates mid-IR selection as an efficient method to find luminous type 2 QSOs and the composite photometry generated by this sample provides a guide for finding more type 2 QSOs at higher redshift in the future.}},

These AGNs are identified by their broad H$α$ or H$β$ emission lines through the NIRCam grism wide-field slitless spectroscopy. One object at $z = 7.646$ with broad H$β$ emission has an F444W magnitude of 23.6 mag, making it one of the brightest $z > 7.5$ broad-line AGNs yet known. Among the 13 AGNs, 10 objects have reddened optical continua with slopes $β\_{\rm opt}>0$. The remaining three objects have their overall SEDs that resemble those of UV-luminous quasars at similar redshifts, but their $β\_{\rm opt}$, though negative, are not as blue as those of unobscured quasars. We also obtain MIRI photometry at 7.7-18 $μ$m for two AGNs and place strong constraints on their rest- frame near-IR SED. We find no significant variability in the rest-frame UV by comparing the COSMOS-3D and COSMOS-Web F115W images taken apart by 60 days in the rest-frame. We compute the H$α$ luminosity functions (LFs) for the broad H$α$ emitters at $z \approx 5-6$ and find a potential redshift evolution when compared with that of the $z \approx 4-5$ sample. We also derive the H$β$ LF at $z\sim8$ for AGNs and galaxies by combining our sample with those from the literature. The broad H$β$ emitters in this work suggest a number density two orders of magnitude higher than that predicted by the quasar LF based on rest-frame UV-selected samples. As a preview, our work showcases the ability of the COSMOS-3D grism survey to provide a complete view of the properties, growth, and evolution of bright broad-line AGNs at $z>5$.}},

Previous studies showed that AGN variability does not have strong redshift evolution, and scales with their bolometric luminosity and BH mass, making it a powerful probe to identify low-mass, low-luminosity AGNs at high redshift.

This LRD sample covers a redshift range of 3 < z < 8 with ‑21.3 < M$\_{UV}$ < ‑18.4. Based on both photometry and imaging difference analyses, we find a mean magnitude difference of {\ensuremath{\sim}}0.15 {\ensuremath{\pm}} 0.26 mag, with none of the LRDs showing photometric variability at 3{\ensuremath{\sigma}} significance. Extrapolation of Sloan Digital Sky Survey quasar variability predicts a magnitude change of order 0.3 mag for our LRD sample.

    abstract = {{Galaxies grow alongside their central supermassive black holes (SMBHs), linked through fueling and feedback. However, the origins and details of this co-evolution remain unclear and differ significantly amongst modeling frameworks. Using a suite of semi-analytic models (SAMs), we trace SMBH mass assembly across $M\_{\rm BH} \sim 10^{6-10}, \mathrm{M}\_{\odot}$. We find significant discrepancies between observations and physics-based models of the local black hole mass function (BHMF), likely due to differences in the underlying stellar mass function and the scaling relations therefrom used to infer the BHMF. However, most physics-based models agree at $z \sim 1-4$ and align reasonably well with broad-line AGN BHMF from JWST observations at $z=4-5$. Most physics-based models reproduce the bolometric AGN luminosity evolution, except \{\textbackslashsc Dark Sage\}, which predicts an excess deviating from models and observations. Interestingly, this pronounced ``knee' in the bolometric AGN luminosity function predicted by \{\textbackslashsc Dark Sage\} around $L\_{\rm bol} \sim 10^{46} \, \mathrm{erg \, s^{-1}}$ is consistent with the inferred luminosity of ``Little Red Dots'' at $z=5-6$, assuming that their entire emission originates from AGN activity. We analyze black hole mass build-up and accretion histories in \{\textbackslashsc Dark Sage\}, which, unlike other models, allows for super-Eddington accretion. We report that on average, SMBHs in \{\textbackslashsc Dark Sage\} primarily grow through secular disk instabilities and merger-driven cold gas accretion, while black hole mergers contribute 60\textbackslash\% of the total mass budget only for the most massive SMBHs by $z=0$.}},

However, their number density is uncertain at $z<4$ due to the small sky coverage and limited blue wavelength coverage of JWST. We present our ground-based search for LRDs at $2\lesssim z\lesssim4$, combining ultra-deep Hyper Suprime-Cam photometry and various (near-)infrared surveys within a total area of $\sim3.1\,\mathrm{deg^{2}}$. We find that for LRDs with $M\_{5500}<-22.5$, their number density declines from $\sim10^{-4.5}\,\mathrm{cMpc^{-3}}$ at $z>4$ to $\sim10^{-5.3}\,\mathrm{cMpc^{-3}}$ at $2.7<z<3.7$ and $\sim10^{-5.7}\,\mathrm{cMpc^{-3}}$ at $1.7<z<2.7$. We also present the Magellan/FIRE spectrum of our first followed-up candidate, DEEP23-z2LRD1 at $z\_\mathrm{spec}=2.26$, as a proof of concept for our sample selection. Similar to high-redshift LRDs, the spectrum of DEEP23-z2LRD1 exhibits broad H$α$ emission with $\mathrm{FWHM}\approx2400\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$ and with nearly symmetric narrow H$α$ absorption. Additionally, DEEP23-z2LRD1 has extremely narrow [OIII] lines with $\mathrm{FWHM}\approx140\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$, suggesting the presence of an accreting black hole in a low-mass host galaxy. Limited by the angular resolution of ground-based surveys, we emphasize that spectroscopic follow-ups are required to characterize the contamination fraction of this sample and pin down LRD number density at $z<4$.}},

Leveraging new JWST/MIRI imaging from the MIDIS and PAHSPECS programs, we confirm Virgil's extraordinary nature among galaxies in JADES/GOODS-South, exhibiting a strikingly red NIRCam-to-MIRI color (F444W $-$ F1500W = $2.84\pm0.04$ mag). Deep NIRSpec/PRISM spectroscopy from the OASIS program offers key insights into the host galaxy, revealing properties of an average star-forming galaxy during Cosmic Reionization, such as a subsolar metallicity, low-to-moderate dust content, and a relatively high ionization parameter and electron temperature. By estimating the star formation rate of Virgil from UV and H$α$, we find evidence that the galaxy is either entering or fading out of a bursty episode. Although line-ratio diagnostics employed at high-$z$ would classify Virgil as an Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN), this classification becomes ambiguous once redshift evolution is considered. Nonetheless, Virgil occupies the same parameter space as recently confirmed AGNs at similar redshifts. The new deep MIRI data at 15 $μ$m reinforce the AGN nature of Virgil, as inferred from multiple spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting codes. Virgil's rising infrared SED and UV excess resemble those of Dust-Obscured Galaxies (DOGs) studied with Spitzer at Cosmic Noon, particularly blue-excess HotDOGs. Our results highlight the need for a multi-wavelength approach incorporating MIRI to uncover such extreme sources at $zrsim6$ and to shed light on the interplay between galaxy evolution and early black hole growth during Cosmic Reionization.}},

We present ALMA observations of three LRDs at $z=3.10$, $4.46$, and $7.04$, targeting molecular and neutral gas via CO(7-6) and [CI](2-1), respectively. We do not detect CO in any target, placing conservative limits on the host molecular gas mass $\lesssim 1$-$5\times10^{10}$ M$\_\odot$. We report the tentative ($4.9\sigma$) detection of the [CI](2-1) line in A2744-45924 ($z=4.46$), one of the brightest known LRDs. The [CI] line is narrow (FWHM $\sim 80$ km s$^{-1}$), implying a dynamical mass $\lesssim 10^{10}$ M$\_\odot$, adopting conservative limits for the galaxy size. The dynamical mass limit is significantly lower than expected from the local $M\_{\rm BH}$-$M\_{\rm dyn}$ relation, and is an order of magnitude below the stellar mass derived from SED fitting, potentially supporting a non-stellar origin of the Balmer break. These results, while tentative, paint a picture of LRDs that is markedly different than typical high-$z$ quasars, which live in massive, gas-rich, and actively star-forming host galaxies.}},

The F356W grism data reveal 124 [O III]+H{\ensuremath{\beta}} emitters at 5.3 < z < 7, 53 of which constitute a protocluster spanning (10 cMpc)$^{2}$ across 6.5 < z < 6.8. We find no evidence of any broad-line active galactic nucleus (AGN) in individual galaxies or stacking, reporting a median H{\ensuremath{\beta}} FWHM of 585 {\ensuremath{\pm}} 152 km s$^{‑1}$; however, the mass{\textendash}excitation diagram and ``little red dot'' color and compactness criteria suggest that there are a few AGN candidates on the outskirts of the protocluster. We fit the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of the [O III] emitters with Prospector and Bagpipes and find that none of the SED-derived properties (stellar mass, age, or star formation rate) correlate with proximity to the quasar. While there is no correlation between galaxy age and local galaxy density, we find modest correlations of local galaxy density with increasing stellar mass, decreasing 10{\textendash}100 Myr star formation rate ratios, and decreasing nebular line equivalent widths. We further find that the protocluster galaxies are consistent with being more massive, being older, and hosting higher star formation rates than the field sample at the 3{\ensuremath{\sigma}} level, distributed in a filamentary structure that supports inside-out formation of the protocluster. There is modest evidence that galaxy evolution proceeds differently as a function of the density of local environment within protoclusters during the epoch of reionization, and the central quasar has little effect on the galaxy properties of the surrounding structure.}},

    abstract = {{Recent James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) observations have revealed a population of sources with a compact morphology and a `v-shaped' continuum, namely blue at rest-frame $\lambda<4000$A and red at longer wavelengths. The nature of these sources, called `little red dots' (LRDs), is still debated, since it is unclear if they host active galactic nuclei (AGN) and their number seems to drastically drop at z<4. We utilise the 63 $deg^2$ covered by the quick Euclid Quick Data Release (Q1) to extend the search for LRDs to brighter magnitudes and to lower z than what has been possible with JWST to have a broader view of the evolution of this peculiar galaxy population. The selection is done by fitting the available photometric data (Euclid, Spitzer/IRAC, and ground-based griz data) with two power laws, to retrieve the rest-frame optical and UV slopes consistently over a large redshift range (i.e, z<7.6). We exclude extended objects and possible line emitters, and perform a visual inspection to remove imaging artefacts. The final selection includes 3341 LRD candidates from z=0.33 to z=3.6, with 29 detected in IRAC. Their rest-frame UV luminosity function, in contrast with previous JWST studies, shows that the number density of LRD candidates increases from high-z down to z=1.5-2.5 and decreases at even lower z. Less evolution is apparent focusing on the subsample of more robust LRD candidates having IRAC detections, which is affected by low statistics and limited by the IRAC resolution. The comparison with previous quasar UV luminosity functions shows that LRDs are not the dominant AGN population at z<4. Follow-up studies of these LRD candidates are key to confirm their nature, probe their physical properties and check for their compatibility with JWST sources, since the different spatial resolution and wavelength coverage of Euclid and JWST could select different samples of compact sources.}},

    abstract = {{The origin of the rest-optical emission of compact, red, high-redshift sources known as `little red dots' (LRDs) poses a major puzzle. If interpreted as starlight, it would imply that LRDs would constitute the densest stellar systems in the Universe. However, alternative models suggest active galactic nuclei (AGN) may instead power the rest-optical continuum. Here, we present JWST/NIRSpec, NIRCam and MIRI observations from the RUBIES and PRIMER programs of The Cliff: a bright LRD at $z=3.55$ with an exceptional Balmer break, twice as strong as that of any high- redshift source previously observed. The spectra also reveal broad Hydrogen (H$PLACEHOLDERalphaPLACEHOLDER \rm FWHM\sim1500$km/s) and He I emission, but no significant metal lines. We demonstrate that massive evolved stellar populations cannot explain the observed spectrum, even when considering unusually steep and strong dust attenuation, or reasonable variations in the initial mass function. Moreover, the formally best-fit stellar mass and compact size ($M\_*\sim10^{10.5}\,M\_\odot,\ r\_{e}\sim40\,$pc) would imply densities at which near-monthly stellar collisions might lead to significant X-ray emission. We argue that the Balmer break, emission lines, and H$\alpha$ absorption line are instead most plausibly explained by a `black hole star' (BH*) scenario, in which dense gas surrounds a powerful ionising source. In contrast to recently proposed BH* models of dust-reddened AGN, we show that spectral fits in the rest UV to near-infrared favour an intrinsically redder continuum over strong dust reddening. This may point to a super-Eddington accreting massive black hole or, possibly, the presence of (super)massive stars in a nuclear star cluster. The Cliff is the clearest evidence to date that at least some LRDs are not ultra-dense, massive galaxies, and are instead powered by a central ionising source embedded in dense, absorbing gas.}},

For the first time, we compare LRDs in $M\_{\rm bh}$-$M\_{\star}$ diagrams with an array of $z=0$ galaxy-morphology-dependent scaling relations, along with the $M\_{\rm bh}$-$M\_{\rm \star,nsc}$ relation for nuclear star clusters. The $M\_{\rm bh}$-$M\_{\rm \star,sph}$ relations for spheroidal stellar systems are characterised by a nearly parallel set of quasi-quadratic (or steeper) distributions that are known to trace the `punctuated equilibrium' of galaxies, reflecting their stepwise growth in black hole mass and merger-built bulge/spheroid mass. We show that LRDs are not equivalent to nuclear star clusters, with the latter having higher $M\_{\rm bh}/M\_{\star}$ ratios. However, the least massive LRDs exhibit similar $M\_{\rm bh}$ and $M\_{\rm \star,gal}$ values as ultracompact dwarf (UCD) galaxies. We show that the LRDs span the $M\_{\rm bh}$-$M\_{\rm \star,gal}$ diagram from UCD galaxies to primaeval lenticular galaxies. In contrast, spiral galaxies and the subset of major-merger-built early-type galaxies define offset relations. Additionally, we observe that low-$z$ galaxies with active galactic nuclei align with the steep black hole scaling relations for disc galaxies defined by primarily inactive galaxies with directly measured black hole masses. Collectively, this highlights the benefits of considering galaxy morphology, which reflects their accretion and merger history, to understand the coevolution of galaxies and their black holes.}},

    abstract = {{JWST has revealed an abundance of compact, red objects at z {\ensuremath{\approx}} 5{\textendash}8 dubbed ``little red dots'' (LRDs), whose SEDs display a faint blue UV continuum followed by a steep rise in the optical. Despite extensive study of their characteristic V-shaped SEDs, the nature of LRDs remains unknown. We present a new analysis of the NIRSpec/PRISM spectrum of A2744-QSO1, a triply imaged LRD at z = 7.04 from the UNCOVER survey. The spectrum shows a strong Balmer break and broad Balmer emission lines, both of which are difficult to explain with models invoking exclusively AGN or stellar contributions. Our fiducial model decomposes the spectrum into a post-starburst galaxy dominating the UV-optical continuum and a reddened AGN being subdominant at all wavelengths and contributing at a level of {\ensuremath{\sim}}20\%. However, this model infers a stellar mass of M$\_{{\ensuremath{\star}}}$ {\ensuremath{\approx}} 4 {\texttimes} {}10$^{9}$ M$\_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$ within a radius of r$\_{e}$ < 30 pc, driving its central density to the highest among observations to date. This high central density could be explained if A2744-QSO1 is the early-forming core of a modern-day massive elliptical galaxy that later puffed up via the inside-out growth channel. The models also necessitate an unusually steep dust extinction law to preserve the strong break strength, though this steepness may be explained by a deficit of large dust grains. It is also probable that these challenges reflect our ignorance of A2744-QSO1's true nature. Future variability and reverberation mapping studies could help disentangle the galaxy and AGN contribution to the continuum, and deeper redder observations could also unveil the dust properties in LRDs. *The error code 404 in the title represents that no satisfying model is found for A2744-QSO 1. In computer network communication, the code ``404'' refers to the error occurring when the server cannot find the requested information.}},

However, BH masses in high-$z$ AGN are generally estimated from single-epoch measurements, which are anchored to local relations based on reverberation mapping and carry large systematic uncertainties. Alternate $M\_{\mathrm{BH}}$ detection methods such as dynamical measurements are more reliable but currently only possible in the local Universe or with strongly lensed systems. Recently, dynamical $M\_{\mathrm{BH}}$ measurements were made in a $z\sim2$ lensed quiescent galaxy as well as a sample of six local galaxies identified as likely relics of common quiescent red nugget galaxies at cosmic noon. We compare the $z\sim2$ red nugget and relic BHs to recent results for $4<z<11$ AGN, quasars, and Little Red Dots. Intriguingly, the $z\sim2$ galaxy and local relic galaxies all lie on both the local $M\_{\mathrm{BH}}-M\_\star$ relation for bulges and the $4<z<7$ $M\_{\mathrm{BH}}-M\_\star$ relation. Our results suggest the $M\_{\mathrm{BH}}-M\_\star$ relation for bulges was likely in place at high-$z$ and indicate careful consideration of different evolutionary pathways is needed when building BH scaling relations. While improvements to $M\_{\mathrm{BH}}$ estimates in AGN will increase our confidence in high-$z$ BH masses, detecting BHs in relic galaxies and lensed galaxies presents a complementary probe of the high-$z$ relations.}},

Using this model for cloud-scale SFEs, the galaxy forms stars stochastically, assembling most of its $10^6\textasciitilde {\rm M\_\odot}$ in stars by redshift $z=8$ through two star-forming bursts (SFBs), each lasting $\sim10\textasciitilde {\rm Myr}$, separated by $80\textasciitilde {\rm Myr}$ of quiescence. Clouds reach SFEs up to $80\%$ during the first SFB, forming bound star clusters (densities $\sim10^{2-4} \textasciitilde {\rm M\_\odot\:pc^{-2}}$, radii $\lesssim 3\textasciitilde {\rm pc}$) resembling those observed by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) in strongly lensed galaxies. Star clusters follow a flat power-law mass function with slope $\Gamma \sim -0.4$. The most massive star clusters ($10^{4-5} \textasciitilde {\rm M\_\odot}$) grow through mergers and have metallicity spreads of $0.05 - 0.1$ dex that roughly scale with mass. The second SFB forms loosely bound star clusters with higher metallicities: $-1.95 < \log(Z/{\rm Z\_\odot}) < -1.50$ at lower SFEs ($2 - 20\%$). At $z \sim 8.7$, a nuclear star cluster (NSC) is seeded, growing $83\%$ of its mass ($ 2.4 \times 10^5 \textasciitilde {\rm M\_\odot}$, $20\%$ of the galaxy's stellar mass) through mergers with pre-existing clusters and the rest through in-situ star formation. The early formation of NSCs has interesting implications for seeding supermassive black holes and the population of ``little red dots'' recently discovered by JWST at $z rsim 5$.}},

By incorporating this seeding process with simplified models of BH growth and mergers, we successfully reproduce the observed LRD mass function for moderately large cross sections of $σ\_{0m} \sim 30 \mathrm{cm^2\,g^{-1}}$ and $ω\sim 80\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$, intriguingly consistent with independent local constraints derived from galaxy rotation curves. Our results highlight the potential of high-redshift BH statistics as a complementary probe for constraining SIDM models.}},

    abstract = {{Luminous broad H$\alpha$ emission and red rest-optical SEDs are the hallmark of compact Little Red Dots (LRDs), implying highly attenuated dusty starbursts and/or obscured active galactic nuclei. However, the lack of observed FIR emission has proved difficult to reconcile with the implied attenuated luminosity in these models. Here, we utilize deep new ALMA imaging, new and existing JWST/MIRI imaging, and archival Spitzer/Herschel imaging of two of the rest-optically brightest LRDs ($z=3.1$ and $z=4.47$) to place the strongest constraints on the IR luminosity in LRDs to date. The detections at $\lambda\_\mathrm{rest}=1-4 \ \mu$m imply flat slopes in the rest-IR, ruling out a contribution from hot ($Trsim500$ K) dust. Similarly, FIR non-detections rule out any appreciable cold ($T\lesssim75$ K) dust component. Assuming energy balance, these observations are inconsistent with the typical FIR dust emission of dusty starbursts and quasar torii, which usually show a mixture of cold and hot dust. Additionally, our [$\mathrm{C}\_{II}$] non-detections rule out typical dusty starbursts. We compute empirical maximum IR SEDs and find that both LRDs must have $\log(L\_\mathrm{IR}/L\_\odot) \lesssim 12.2$ at the $3\sigma$ level. These limits are in tension with the predictions of rest-optical spectrophotometric fits, be they galaxy only, AGN only, or composite. It is unlikely that LRDs are highly dust-reddened intrinsically blue sources with a dust temperature distribution that conspires to avoid current observing facilities. Rather, we favor an intrinsically redder LRD SED model that alleviates the need for strong dust attenuation.}},

Here we report two LRDs (ID9094 and ID2756) at z$\_{\rm spec}$>7, recently discovered in the JWST FRESCO GOODS-North field. Both satisfy the ``v-shape'' colors and compactness criteria for LRDs and are identified as Type-I AGN candidates based on their broad H$\beta$ emission lines (full width at half maximum: 2276$\pm$492 km/s for ID9094 and 1069$\pm$239 km/s for ID2756) and narrow [OI] lines ($\sim$ 300-400 km/s). To investigate their nature, we conduct deep NOEMA follow-up observations targeting the [CII] 158${\rm \mu m}$ emission line and the 1.3 mm dust continuum. We do not detect [CII] or 1.3 mm continuum emission for either source. Notably, in the scenario that the two LRDs were DSFGs, we would expect significant detections: $>16\sigma$ for [CII] and $>3\sigma$ for the 1.3 mm continuum of ID9094, and $>5\sigma$ for [CII] of ID2756. Using the 3$\sigma$ upper limits of [CII] and 1.3 mm, we perform two analyses: (1) UV-to-FIR spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting with and without AGN components, and (2) comparison of their properties with the L$\_{[CII]}$-SFR$\_{tot}$ empirical relation. Both analyses indicate that LRDs favor the presence of AGN to explain their observed properties. Our results highlight the importance of far-infrared observations for studying LRDs, a regime that remains largely unexplored.}},

In this paper, we develop a detailed framework to estimate the photometry of AGNs embedded in galaxies extracted from the OBELISK cosmological simulation to understand the properties of color-selected little red dots (cLRDs) in the context of the full AGN and massive black hole population. We find that using realistic spectral energy distributions (SEDs) and attenuation for AGNs we can explain the shape of the cLRD SED as long as galaxies host a sufficiently luminous AGN that is neither overly attenuated nor too little attenuated. When attenuation is too low or too high, AGNs do not enter the cLRD selection, because the AGN dominates over the host galaxy too much in blue filters, or it does not contribute to photometry anywhere, respectively. cLRDs are also characterized by high Eddington ratios, possibility super-Eddington ones, and/or high ratios between the black hole and the stellar mass.}},

    abstract = {{JWST has uncovered large numbers of compact galaxies at high redshift with broad hydrogen/helium lines. These include the enigmatic population known as ``little red dots'' (LRDs). Their nature is debated, but they are thought to be powered by supermassive black holes (SMBHs) or intense star formation. They exhibit unusual properties for SMBHs, such as black holes that are overmassive for their host galaxies and extremely weak X-ray and radio emission. Using the highest-quality JWST spectra, we show here that the lines are broadened by electron scattering with a narrow intrinsic line core. The data require high electron column densities and compact sizes (light days), which, when coupled with their high luminosities can only be explained by SMBH accretion. The narrow intrinsic cores of the lines imply upper limits on the black hole masses of $10^{5-7}$ $M\_{\odot}$, two orders of magnitude lower than previous estimates. These are among the lowest mass SMBHs known at high redshift and suggest that this is a population of young, rapidly growing SMBHs. They are enshrouded in a dense cocoon of ionized gas, probably related to their youth, from which they are accreting close to the Eddington limit. Reprocessed nebular emission from the dense cocoon dominates the optical spectrum, explaining most LRD spectral characteristics and helping to suppress radio and X-ray emission.}},

Several theoretical scenarios have been proposed to seed and rapidly grow black holes, but direct observations of these mechanisms remain elusive. Here we present a source 660 million years after the Big Bang that displays singular properties: among the largest Hydrogen Balmer breaks reported at any redshift, broad multi-peaked H$\beta$ emission, and Balmer line absorption in multiple transitions. We model this source as a ``black hole star'' (BH*) where the Balmer break and absorption features are a result of extremely dense, turbulent gas forming a dust-free ``atmosphere'' around a supermassive black hole. This source may provide evidence of an early black hole embedded in dense gas -- a theoretical configuration proposed to rapidly grow black holes via super- Eddington accretion. Radiation from the BH* appears to dominate almost all observed light, leaving limited room for contribution from its host galaxy. We demonstrate that the recently discovered ``Little Red Dots'' (LRDs) with perplexing spectral energy distributions can be explained as BH*s embedded in relatively brighter host galaxies. This source provides evidence that black hole masses in the LRDs may be over-estimated by orders of magnitude -- the BH* is effectively dust-free contrary to the steep dust corrections applied while modeling LRDs, and the physics that gives rise to the complex line shapes and luminosities may deviate from assumptions underlying standard scaling relations.}},

The observations are part of the JWST Cycle-3 treasury program, Slitless Areal Pure-Parallel HIgh-Redshift Emission Survey (SAPPHIRES) with NIRCam-grism. Using wide field slitless spectroscopy (WFSS) obtained in the MACS0416 parallel field, we robustly confirm nine galaxies at $z\_{\rm spec}\sim8.47$ via emission line detections of [OIII]5008A (with $>5\,\sigma$) and tentatively confirm one additional galaxy (at $\sim3\,\sigma$). This discovery represents the highest-redshift, spectroscopically confirmed galaxy over-density known to date, which is $\sim6$--$8$ times more dense than the average volume density of galaxies at the same redshift. Furthermore, a galaxy hosting a low-mass active galactic nucleus (``Little-Red-Dot'') is found as a member, suggesting an early emergence of active, massive black holes and feedback between these black holes and their surrounding environments. We also discuss the spatial structures connecting the galaxy over-density to nearby massive star- forming galaxies (separated by $\sim 5$pMpc, including MACS0416-Y1 and MACS0416-JD. This finding of a massive dark matter halo hosting a galaxy over-density at $z\sim8.5$ is surprising given that our survey covered only a small, random field ($16.5\,{\rm arcmin^2}$) as part of a pure parallel observation. The comparison with cosmological simulations shows that the likelihood of finding such a large-scale structure is $<5\,\%$ under the current galaxy formation scenario and the observed survey volume. Our results demonstrate the power of WFSS observations to build a complete line-emitter sample and suggest an important role for over-densities in enhancing galaxy formation by funneling large-scale gas supplies into small cosmological volumes.}},

Among these `Little Red Dots' (LRDs), Abell2744-QSO1 at $z=7.04$ has been confirmed to have time-variable equivalent width (EW) in its broad emission lines, confirming its AGN nature. We extend the analysis of NIRSpec/IFS data from the BlackTHUNDER survey to the H$\alpha$ line. The broad-line profile in Abell2744-QSO1 is manifestly non-Gaussian, requiring at least two Gaussian components with full width at half maximum FWHM=$450\pm50$ and $1800\pm100$ km s$^{-1}$. Crucially, we also detect a narrow-line Gaussian component, and strong H$\alpha$ absorption (EW relative to the continuum $\approx 30^{+15}\_{-9}$ A), confirming a connection between the strong Balmer break and line absorption. The absorber is at rest with respect to broad H$\alpha$, suggesting that the gas cannot be interpreted as an inflow or outflow, forming instead a long-lived structure. Its velocity dispersion is $\sigma\_{abs} = 100\pm10$ km s$^{-1}$, consistent with the value inferred from the analysis of the Balmer break. Based on H$\alpha$, we infer a black hole mass of log(M$\_{BH}$/M$\_\odot$)=6.3-6.7, 0.9-1.3 dex smaller than previous estimates based on H$\beta$. The Eddington ratio is 0.7-1.6. Combining the high signal-to-noise ratio of the narrow H$\alpha$ line with the spectral resolution R=3,700 of the G395H grating, we infer a narrow-line dispersion $\sigma\_n = 22^{+5}\_{-6}$ km s$^{-1}$, which places a stringent constraint on the black-hole-to-dynamical-mass ratio of this system to be M$\_{BH}$/M$\_{dyn}$>0.02-0.4. If M$\_{BH}$ is near the low-mass end of our estimates, the SMBH would be accreting at a super- Eddington rate. Alternatively, at the high-M$\_{BH}$ end, there would be minimal room for a host galaxy.}},

One remarkable distinction of these JWST-identified AGNs, compared to their low-redshift counterparts, is that at least {\ensuremath{\sim}}20\% of them present H{\ensuremath{\alpha}} and/or H{\ensuremath{\beta}} absorption, which must be associated with extremely dense ({\ensuremath{\gtrsim}}{}10$^{9}$ cm$^{‑3}$) gas in the broad- line region or its immediate surroundings. These Balmer absorption features unavoidably imply the presence of a Balmer break caused by the same dense gas. In this Letter, we quantitatively demonstrate that a Balmer break can form in AGN spectra without stellar components, when the accretion disk is heavily embedded in dense neutral gas clumps with densities of {\ensuremath{\sim}}10$^{9‑11}$ cm$^{‑3}$, where hydrogen atoms are collisionally excited to the n = 2 states and effectively absorb the AGN continuum at the bluer side of the Balmer limit. The nonstellar origin of a Balmer break offers a potential solution to the large stellar masses and densities inferred for little red dots (LRDs) when assuming that their continuum is primarily due to stellar light. Our calculations indicate that the observed Balmer absorption blueshifted by a few hundred km s$^{‑1}$, which suggests the presence of dense outflows in the nucleus at rates exceeding the Eddington value. Other spectral features such as higher equivalent widths of broad H{\ensuremath{\alpha}} emission and presence of O I lines observed in high-redshift AGNs including LRDs align with the predicted signatures of a dense super-Eddington accretion disk.}},

While the optical continuum is thought to originate from the accretion disk, the origin of the UV continuum has been largely unclear. We report the detection of the strong rest-frame UV emission lines of C III] {\ensuremath{\lambda}}{\ensuremath{\lambda}}1907, 1909 and C IV {\ensuremath{\lambda}}{\ensuremath{\lambda}}1549, 1551 in a ``little red dot'' AGN, COS-66964. Spectroscopically confirmed at z = 7.0371, COS-66964 exhibits broad H{\ensuremath{\alpha}} emission (FWHM {\ensuremath{\sim}} 2000 km s$^{‑1}$) and weak broad H{\ensuremath{\beta}}, implying significant dust attenuation to the broad-line region (<inline-formula> </inline- formula>).

While marginal He II {\ensuremath{\lambda}}4687 and [Fe X] {\ensuremath{\lambda}}6376 detections further indicate that the AGN dominates in the rest- frame optical, the nondetection of He II {\ensuremath{\lambda}}1640 in the UV despite high EW C III] and C IV ({\ensuremath{\sim}}35 {\r{A}}) is more consistent with photoionization by massive stars. The nondetection of Mg II {\ensuremath{\lambda}}{\ensuremath{\lambda}}2800 is similarly inconsistent with an AGN scattered light interpretation. Assuming the rest-frame UV is dominated by stellar light, we derive a stellar mass of <inline-formula> </inline-formula>, implying an elevated M$\_{BH}$/M$\_{{\ensuremath{\star}}}$ ratio {\ensuremath{\sim}}2 orders of magnitude above the local relation, but consistent with other high-z AGN discovered by JWST. The source is unresolved in all bands, implying a very compact size {\ensuremath{\lesssim}}200 pc in the UV. This suggests that the simultaneous buildup of compact stellar populations (i.e., galaxy bulges) and the central SMBH is ongoing even at z {\ensuremath{\gtrsim}} 7.}},

These values are significantly higher and lower respectively than recent similar works, which we accredit to the limiting resolution of the R1000 spectroscopy and a stricter outflow selection criterion. We find no correlation between the outflow velocity and the galaxy stellar mass or star-formation rate. The median ratio between outflow velocity and escape velocity is 0.77(+0.36)(-0.32), indicating that most outflows cannot escape the galaxy gravitational potentials.

It is very likely that LRDs host obscured broad-line active galactic nuclei (AGNs). In the meanwhile, Green Pea galaxies (GPs), which are compact dwarf galaxies at low redshift, share various similar properties with high-redshift star-forming galaxies. Here, we aim to find the connection between the LRDs and GPs hosting broad-line AGNs (BLGPs). With a sample of 19 BLGPs obtained from our previous work, we further identify seven GPs with V-shaped rest-frame UV- to-optical SEDs that are likely local analogs to LRDs. These V-shaped BLGPs exhibit faint UV absolute magnitudes and sub- Eddington rates similar to those of LRDs. Three of them occupy a similar region to LRDs in the Baldwin{\textendash}Philips{\textendash}Terlevich diagram, suggesting they have similar ionization conditions and gas-phase metallicities to LRDs. These similarities suggest that V-shaped BLGPs can be taken as local analogs of high-redshift LRDs. In addition, most (16/19) BLGPs, including six V-shaped BLGPs, host overmassive black holes (BHs) above the local M$\_{BH}${\textendash}M$\_{*}$ relation, making it the first sample of galaxies hosting overmassive BHs at z < 0.4. These findings will help us learn more about the formation and coevolution of early galaxies and BHs.}},

    abstract = {{Recently, a large number of compact sources at z > 4 with blue UV slopes and extremely red rest-frame optical slopes have been found in James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) extragalactic surveys. As a subsample of these sources, commonly called ``little red dots'' (LRDs), have been spectroscopically observed to host a broad- line active galactic nucleus (AGN), they have been the focus of multiple recent studies in an attempt to understand the origin of their UV and optical emission. Here, we assemble a sample of 123 LRDs from the literature along with spectroscopic and photometric JWST-identified samples of AGNs to compare their colors and spectral slopes. We find that while obscured AGNs at z < 6 have highly dissimilar colors to LRDs, unobscured AGNs at z < 6 span a wide range of colors, with only a subsample showing colors similar to LRDs. At z > 6, the majority of the unobscured AGNs that have been found in these samples are LRDs, but this may be related to the fact that these sources are at large bolometric luminosities. Because LRDs occupy a unique position in galaxy color space, they are more straightforward to target, and the large number of broad-line AGNs that do not have LRD colors and slopes are therefore underrepresented in many spectroscopic surveys because they are more difficult to preselect. Current LRD selection techniques return a large and disparate population, including many sources having 2{\textendash}5 {\ensuremath{\mu}}m colors impacted by emission- line flux boosting in individual filters.}},

We fit these sources with multiple substellar atmosphere models and present the atmospheric parameters, including effective temperature (T$\_{eff}$), surface gravity, and other derived properties.

The best-fit model spectra provide a reasonable match to the observed spectra. However, distinct residuals exist in the Y, J, and H bands for the two L dwarf candidates, particularly for o006\_s35616. Incorporating the extinction parameter into the fitting process can significantly reduce these residuals. The distance estimates indicate that these candidates are about 2 kpc away. The analysis of the color{\textendash}color diagram using multiple JWST NIRcam photometry suggests that cooler T dwarfs, such as o006\_s00089, overlap with little red dots, while hotter L dwarfs, like o005\_s41280 and o006\_s35616, tend to contaminate the high- redshift galaxy cluster.

    abstract = {{The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) observations have revolutionized extragalactic research, particularly with the discovery of little red dots (LRDs), which have been discovered as a population of dust-reddened broad-line active galactic nuclei (AGNs). Their unique V-shaped spectral feature, characterized by a red optical continuum and a UV excess in the rest frame, challenges us to discern the relative contributions of the galaxy and AGN. We study a spectral energy distribution (SED) model for LRDs from rest-frame UV to infrared bands. We hypothesize that the incident radiation from an AGN, characterized by a typical SED, is embedded in an extended dusty medium with an extinction law similar to those seen in dense regions such as Orion Nebula or certain AGN environments. The UV‑optical spectrum is described by dust-attenuated AGN emission, featuring a red optical continuum at {\ensuremath{\lambda}} > 4000 {\r{A}} and a flat UV spectral shape established through a gray extinction curve at {\ensuremath{\lambda}} < 3000 {\r{A}}, due to the absence of small-size grains. There is no need for additional stellar emission or AGN scattered light. In the infrared, the SED is shaped by an extended dust and gas distribution ({\ensuremath{\gamma}} < 1; {\ensuremath{\rho}} {\ensuremath{\propto}} r$^{‑{\ensuremath{\gamma}}}$) with characteristic gas densities of ≃10{\textendash}{}10$^{3}$ cm$^{‑3}$, which allows relatively cool dust temperatures to dominate the radiation. As a result, these dust structures shift the emission energy peak from near-infrared to mid-infrared bands in the rest frame; for sources at z \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde 4{\textendash}7, the corresponding wavelengths shift from the JWST/MIRI to Herschel range. This model, unlike the typical AGN hot torus models, can produce an infrared SED flattening that is consistent with LRD observations through JWST MIRI. Such a density structure can arise from the coexistence of inflows and outflows during the early assembly of galactic nuclei. This might be the reason why LRDs emerge preferentially in the high-redshift Universe younger than 1 billion years.}},

Among the most intriguing JWST discoveries are red, very compact objects that show broad line emission features, nicknamed little red dots (LRDs). The discovery of LRDs has triggered great interest in their origin as either extremely starbursting galaxies or highly obscured active galactic nuclei (AGNs). Their exact nature remains unknown. Aims. The goal of this work is to estimate the radio emission from LRDs and predict which radio surveys would detect them. To achieve these objectives, we employed the fundamental plane of black hole (BH) accretion to estimate radio emission from AGNs and the stellar radio fluxes from their host galaxies. We assumed a range of BH masses, X-ray luminosities (L$\_{X}$), and star formation rates (SFRs) to bracket the likely properties of LRDs. Methods. Our findings suggest that BH radio fluxes from LRDs are 10{\textendash}100 times higher than the stellar fluxes from their host galaxies, depending on the BH mass, L$\_{X}$, and SFR. The detection of a {\ensuremath{\sim}}500 nJy signal above 2 GHz at z {\ensuremath{\geq}} 5 or a {\ensuremath{\sim}}2000 nJy flux at z = 3{\textendash}4 would be a smoking gun for the presence of AGNs provided that SFRs in the host galaxies are < 30 M$\_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$ yr$^{‑1}$. Results. We find that LRDs are most likely radio-quiet AGNs; otherwise, they would have already been detected in the current radio surveys. Our findings suggest that LRDs can be detected with upcoming radio observatories such as ngVLA and SKA with integration times of 10{\textendash}100 h, respectively.}},

    abstract = {{Recent observations from JWST have revealed an abundant population of active galactic nuclei (AGN) and so-called ``Little Red Dots'' (LRDs) at $2\lesssim z \lesssim 11$, many of which are characterized by V-shaped UV-to-optical continua with turnovers around the Balmer limit. The physical nature of these LRDs is unclear, and it remains debated whether the peculiar spectral shape originates from AGN, compact galaxies, or both. We present the analysis of new NIRSpec-IFU data from the BlackTHUNDER JWST Large Programme and archival NIRSpec-MSA data of a lensed LRD at $z=7.04$. The spectra confirm the presence of a smooth Balmer break and a broad H$\beta$ tracing the Broad Line Region (BLR) of an AGN. The small velocity dispersion of the H$\beta$ narrow component indicates a small dynamical mass of the host galaxy of $M\_{\rm dyn}<4 \times 10^8\textasciitilde M\_{\odot}$, which implies that the stellar population cannot contribute more than 10\% to the optical continuum. We show that the Balmer break can be well described by an AGN continuum absorbed by very dense ($n\_{\rm H}\sim 10^{10}\textasciitilde {\rm cm^{-3}}$) and nearly dust-free gas along our line-of-sight (possibly gas in the BLR or its surrounding). The same gas is expected to produce H$\beta$ absorption, at a level consistent with a tentative detection ($3\sigma$) in the high-resolution spectrum. Such a non-stellar origin of the Balmer break may apply to other LRDs, and would alleviate the issue of extremely high stellar mass surface densities inferred in the case of a stellar interpretation of the Balmer break. We note that this is a rare case of a black hole that is overmassive relative to both the host galaxy stellar and dynamical masses. We finally report indications of variability and the first attempt of AGN reverberation mapping at such an early epoch.}},

    abstract = {{We combine stellar mass functions and the recent first JWST-based galaxy-black hole scaling relations at z=6 to for the first time compute the supermassive black hole (SMBH) mass volume density at this epoch, and compare this to the integrated SMBH mass growth from the population of UV-luminous quasars at z>6. We show that even under very conservative assumptions almost all growth of SMBH mass at z>6 does not take place in these UV- luminous quasars, but must occur in systems obscured through dust and/or with lower radiative efficiency than standard thin accretion disks. The 'Soltan argument' is not fulfilled by the known population of bright quasars at z>6: the integrated SMBH mass growth inferred from these largely unobscured active galactic nuclei (AGN) in the early Universe is by a factor $$10 smaller than the total SMBH mass volume density at z=6. This is valid under a large range of assumption about luminosity, mass functions, and accretion modes, and is likely still a factor >2 smaller when accounting for known obscuration fractions at this epoch. The resulting consequences are: >90\%, possibly substantially more, of SMBH-buildup in the early Universe does not take place in luminous unobscured quasar phases, but has to occur in obscured systems, with dust absorbing most of the emitted UV-visible AGN emission, potentially with accretion modes with super-Eddington specific accretion rates. This is consistent with short lifetimes for luminous quasar phases from quasar proximity zone studies and clustering. This would remove the empirical need for slow SMBH growth and hence exotic 'high- mass seed' black holes at early cosmic time. It also predicts a large population of luminous but very obscured lower-mass quasars at z>6, possibly the JWST 'Little Red Dots'.}},

    abstract = {{By analyzing data from DESI Legacy Imaging Survey of the dwarf galaxies in the Arecibo Legacy Fast Alfa Survey, we have identified five ultradiffuse galaxies (UDGs) featuring central pseudobulges. These UDGs display blue pseudobulges with S{\'e}rsic indices n < 2.5 and effective radii spanning 300{\textendash}700 pc, along with bluer thin stellar disks exhibiting low surface brightness and expansive effective radii that align with the UDG definition. The rotation velocities of these UDGs, determined using H I line widths and optical inclinations, exceed those of most dwarf galaxies of similar mass, suggesting the high halo spins or substantial dark matter halos. We propose that these UDGs likely formed through mergers of dwarf galaxies lacking old stars in their progenitors, resulting in the development of central bulge-like structures during starbursts triggered by the mergers while also enhancing their halo spin. Subsequent gas accretion facilitated the formation of extended stellar disks. It is also worth noting the possibility that these UDGs could alternatively represent ``failed L$^{{\ensuremath{\star}}}$ galaxies'' with massive dark matter halos but reduced star formation efficiencies. If future high-resolution H I observations confirm the presence of massive halos around these UDGs, they may have formed due to intense AGN feedback in the early Universe and may be the descendants of ``little red dots'' observed by the James Webb Space Telescope, which are characterized by heightened central black hole masses and intensified accretion and feedback processes in the early Universe.}},

We investigate the impact of spectral energy distribution fitting methods, assumed star formation histories (SFHs), dust laws, and priors on galaxy masses and the resultant GSMF. While our fiducial GSMF agrees with the literature at z < 13.5, we find that the assumed SFH model has a large impact on the GSMF and stellar mass density (SMD), finding a 0.75 dex increase in the SMD at z = 10.5 between a flexible nonparametric and standard parametric SFH. Overall, we find a flatter SMD evolution at z {\ensuremath{\geq}} 9 than some studies predict, suggesting a rapid buildup of stellar mass in the early Universe. We find no incompatibility between our results and those of standard cosmological models, as suggested previously, although the most massive galaxies may require a high star formation efficiency. We find that the ``little red dot'' galaxies dominate the z = 7 GSMF at high masses, necessitating a better understanding of the relative contributions of active galactic nucleus and stellar emission. We show that assuming a theoretically motivated top-heavy initial mass function (IMF) reduces stellar mass by 0.5 dex without affecting fit quality, but our results remain consistent with existing cosmological models with a standard IMF.}},

Using a NIRCam-only selection to F444W < 27.7 mag, we find 26 sources over the {\ensuremath{\sim}}45 arcmin$^{2}$ field that are blue in F115W ‑ F200W {\ensuremath{\sim}} 0 (or {\ensuremath{\beta}} $\_{UV}$ {\ensuremath{\sim}} {\textendash}2.0 for f $\_{ {\ensuremath{\lambda}} }$ {\ensuremath{\propto}} {\ensuremath{\lambda}} $^{ {\ensuremath{\beta}} }$), red in F200W ‑ F444W = 1‑4 ({\ensuremath{\beta}} $\_{opt}$ {\ensuremath{\sim}} +2.0), and are dominated by a point-source-like central component. Of the 20 sources with deep Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) 1.2 mm coverage, none are detected individually or in a stack. For the majority of the sample, spectral energy distribution fits to the JWST+ALMA observations prefer models with hot dust rather than obscured star formation to reproduce the red NIRCam colors and ALMA 1.2 mm nondetections. While compact dusty star formation cannot be ruled out, the combination of extremely small sizes (<r $\_{ e }$> {\ensuremath{\approx}} 50 pc after correction for magnification), red rest-frame optical slopes, and hot dust can be explained by reddened broad-line active galactic nuclei (AGNs).

These objects are likely compact dusty starbursts or heavily reddened AGNs, playing a pivotal role in early black hole growth, dust production, and stellar assembly. We introduce a new photometric selection to identify LRDs over a broad range in redshifts and rest-frame UV-to-NIR colors enabling a more complete census of the population. This method identifies 248 LRDs with F444W$<27$ mag over 263 arcmin$^2$ in the JADES, PRIMER-COSMOS, and UDS fields with MIRI coverage, increasing the number density by $\times$1.7 compared to previous samples, suggesting that previous census were underestimated. Most LRDs are detected in MIRI/F770W but only 7\% (17) are detected in F1800W. We use MIRI-based rest-frame [1$-$3 $\mu$m] colors to trace dust emission. F1800W-detected LRDs have a median [1$-$3 $\mu$m]$=1.5$ mag, with a broad scatter indicative of diverse dust emission properties. About 20\% exhibit [1$-$3 $\mu$m]$<1$ mag colors consistent with negligible dust emission, but the majority show significant dust emission at 3 $\mu$m (f$^{\rm dust}\_{3\mu m}\lesssim0.8$) from the galaxy ISM or a hot-dust- deficient AGN torus. A correlation between bluer UV-to-NIR colors and stronger IR emission suggests that the bluest LRDs may resemble unobscured QSOs. We report a LRD at $z\_{\rm spec}=3.1386$, detected in MIRI, Spitzer/MIPS, and Herschel/PACS. Its IR SED rises steeply at $\lambda\_{\rm rest}>6\textasciitilde \mu$m and peaks near $\sim40\textasciitilde \mu$m, providing the first direct evidence of warm dust emission (T$=50-100$ K) in a LRD.}},

Their remarkably high luminosities at redshifts 5 < z < 10, appear to challenge LambdaCDM cosmology and galaxy formation models, as they imply stellar masses and star formation rates that exceed the upper limits set by these models. LRDs are currently subjects of debate as the mechanisms behind their high luminosities are not yet fully understood. LRD energy outputs are thought to be either dominated by star formation or their energy output results from the hosting of active galactic nuclei. We investigate the starburst hypothesis by attempting to replicate the stellar properties of LRDs using output data from the FLARES simulation suite. Comparative analysis of galactic properties such as galactic number density, stellar mass and star formation rate yield significant tension between simulated and observed galaxies. The FLARES simulation overestimates the number densities of galaxies with stellar masses similar to observed LRDs by several orders of magnitude. Additionally, the simulation shows an overestimation of star formation rates. These tensions suggest a potential underestimation by the FLARES model of stellar feedback mechanisms such as active galactic nuclei feedback. These results suggest that the starburst hypothesis may be insufficient to explain the observed properties of these galaxies. Instead, the AGN scenario should be further investigated by repeating the methods in this study with a hydrodynamic galaxy simulation suite that models a higher influence of AGN feedback mechanisms on stellar activity in high redshift galaxies.}},

Their nature currently remains elusive, despite their surprisingly high inferred number densities. This emerging population of red point-like sources is reshaping our view of the early Universe and may shed light on the formation of high-redshift supermassive black holes. Here we present a spectroscopically confirmed LRD CANUCS-LRD-z8.6 at $z\_{\rm spec}=8.6319\pm 0.0005$ hosting an Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN), using JWST data. This source shows the typical spectral shape of an LRD (blue UV and red optical continuum, unresolved in JWST imaging), along with broad H$\beta$ line emission, detection of high-ionization emission lines (CIV, NIV]) and very high electron temperature indicative of the presence of AGN. This is also combined with a very low metallicity ($Z<0.1 Z\_\odot$). The presence of all these diverse features in one source makes CANUCS-LRD-z8.6 unique. We show that the inferred black hole mass of CANUCS-LRD-z8.6 ($M\_{\rm BH}=1.0^{+0.6}\_{-0.4}\times 10^{8}\rm \textasciitilde M\_\odot$) strongly challenges current standard theoretical models and simulations of black hole formation, and forces us to adopt `ad hoc' prescriptions. Indeed if massive seeds, or light seeds with super-Eddington accretion, are considered, the observed BH mass of CANUCS-LRD-z8.6 at $z=8.6$ can be reproduced. Moreover, the black hole is over-massive compared to its host, relative to the local $M\_{\rm BH}-M\_*$ relations, pointing towards an earlier and faster evolution of the black hole compared to its host galaxy.}},

    abstract = {{``Little Red Dots'' (LRDs) are an abundant high-redshift population newly discovered by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). They are characterized by a red color in the rest-frame optical band, compact morphology, and broad Balmer emission lines (${\rm FWHM} rsim 1000\textasciitilde {\rm km\,s^{-1}}$) that suggest an AGN nature. Using a method of pixel-by-pixel color selection and relaxing the compactness criteria, we identify three of the first dual LRD candidates in the COSMOS-Web survey with projected separations of $0.\!\!^{\prime\prime}2-0.\!\!^{\prime\prime}4$ (1-2 pkpc at their photometric redshifts). A comparison between existing LRD samples and mock data reveals that the projected separations of these dual LRD candidates are unlikely to result from chance projections of objects at different redshifts. In one case (CW-B5-15958), the dual LRD includes two bright sources ($m\_{\rm F444W}=24.3$ and $24.8$) with characteristic V-shape spectral energy distribution (SEDs) and photometric redshifts consistent with each other. We find that CW-B5-15958 has a faint off- centered component and a companion galaxy. In the other two dual systems, the brighter LRD exhibits a V-shape SED, while the fainter LRD ($m\_{\rm F444W}rsim26$) is undetected in both F115W and F150W. These discoveries suggest that the angular auto- correlation function (ACF) of LRDs exhibits a significant excess ($\sim3\times10^2$ times) on sub-arcsec (kilo-parsec) separations compared to the extrapolation of a power-law ACF of JWST-found AGNs measured over $10^{\prime\prime}-100^{\prime\prime}$. Follow-up spectroscopic confirmation of their redshifts and the construction of a larger sample are essential to advance our understanding of the evolution of supermassive black holes and the importance of mergers in the early universe.}},

    abstract = {{Context. High-redshift observations of {}10$^{9}$ M$\_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$ supermassive black holes (SMBHs) at z {\ensuremath{\sim}} 7 and 'little red dots' that may host over- massive black holes (BHs) at z > 4 suggests the existence of so- called heavy seeds (> 1000 M$\_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$) in the early Universe. Recent work has suggested that the rapid assembly of halos may be the key to forming heavy seeds early enough in the Universe to match such observations, as the high rate of accretion into the halo suppresses the cooling ability of H$\_{2}$, allowing it to quickly accrete up to the atomic cooling limit of {}10$^{7}$ M$\_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$ prior to the run-away collapse of baryonic gas within its dark matter (DM) potential, without the need for extreme radiation fields or DM streaming velocities. Aims. While the rapid assembly of halos can lead to increased halo masses upon the onset of collapse, it remains unclear if this leads to higher-mass BH seeds. As a common route for halos to grow rapidly is via halo-halo mergers, we aim to test what effects such a merger occurring during the initial gas collapse has on the formation of BH seeds. Methods. We performed simulations of BH seed formation in four distinct idealised halo collapse scenarios: an isolated {}10$^{6}$ M$\_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$ minihalo, an isolated {}10$^{7}$ M$\_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$ atomic halo, the direct collision of two {}10$^{7}$ M$\_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$ halos, and a fly-by collision of two {}10$^{7}$ M$\_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$ halos. We simulated the collapse of the gas down to scales of {\ensuremath{\sim}}0.0075 pc before inserting sink particles as BH seeds and captured a further 10 Myr of accretion. Results. We have shown that halo collisions create a central environment of increased density, inside which BH seeds can accrete at higher rates. For direct collisions, the gas density peaks are disrupted by the interaction, as the collisionless DM peaks pass through each other while the colliding gas is left in the centre, removing the BH from its accretion source. When the central density peaks instead experience a fly-by interaction, the BH remains embedded in the dense gas and maintains higher accretion rates throughout the simulated period compared to the isolated halo cases. The total simulated period was 70 Myr, and we followed the evolution of the BH for the final 10 Myr. The BH spends the final 6 Myr embedded in the dense, shocked region. The final mass of the BH is a factor of 2 greater than in the isolated atomic halo case, and a factor of 3 greater than the minihalo case, reaching {}10$^{4}$ M$\_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$ via its 0.03 pc accretion radius. As the maximum halo mass before collapse is determined by the atomic cooling limit of a few times {}10$^{7}$ M$\_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$, the ability of halo-halo mergers to further boost the rates of accretion onto the central object may play a crucial role in growing SMBH seeds, which is needed to explain recent observations of seemingly over-massive BHs at high redshifts.}},

The NIRCam spectra reveal high rest-frame EW $W\_{H\alpha,0,broad}>800${\r{A}}, broad H$\alpha$ emission (FWHM$\sim$4500 km/s), on top of narrow, complex absorption.

The spectra unambiguously demonstrate a broad-line region associated with an inferred $M\_{BH}\sim10^9M\_\odot$ supermassive black hole embedded in dense gas, which might explain a non-detection in ultradeep Chandra X-ray data (>$10\times$ underluminous relative to broad $L\_{H\alpha}$). Strong UV Nitrogen lines suggest supersolar N/O ratios due to rapid star formation or intense radiation near the AGN. The continuum shows a clear Balmer break at rest-frame 3650{\r{A}}, which cannot be accounted for by an AGN power-law alone. A stellar population model produces an excellent fit with a reddened Balmer break and implying a massive ($M\_*\sim8\times10^{10}M\_\odot$), old $\sim$500 Myr, compact stellar core, among the densest stellar systems known ($PLACEHOLDERrhoPLACEHOLDERsim3\times10^6M\_\odot$/pc$^2$ for $R\_{e,opt}=70\pm10$ pc), and AGN emission with extreme intrinsic EW $W\_{H\alpha,0}\gg$1000{\r{A}}. However, although high $M\_*$ and $M\_{BH}$ are supported by evidence of an overdensity containing 40 galaxies at $z=4.41-4.51$, deep high-resolution spectroscopy is required to confirm stellar absorption and rule out that dense gas around the AGN causes the Balmer break instead.}},

    abstract = {{Early JWST studies found an apparent population of massive, compact galaxies at redshifts z {\ensuremath{\gtrsim}} 7. Recently three of these galaxies were shown to have prominent Balmer breaks, demonstrating that their light at {\ensuremath{\lambda}}$\_{rest}$ {\ensuremath{\sim}} 3500 {\r{A}} is dominated by a stellar population that is relatively old ({\ensuremath{\sim}}200 Myr). All three also have broad H{\ensuremath{\beta}} emission with {\ensuremath{\sigma}} > 1000 km s$^{‑1}$, a common feature of such ``little red dots.'' From S{\'e}rsic profile fits to the Near Infrared Camera images in F200W we find that the stellar light of galaxies is extremely compact: the galaxies have half-light radii of r$\_{e}$ {\ensuremath{\sim}} 100 pc, in the regime of ultracompact dwarfs in the nearby Universe. Their masses are uncertain, as they depend on the contribution of possible light from an active galactic nucleus (AGN) to the flux at {\ensuremath{\lambda}}$\_{rest}$ > 5000 {\r{A}}. If the AGN contribution is low beyond the Balmer break region, the masses are M$\_{*}$ {\ensuremath{\sim}} {}10$^{10}${\textendash}{}10$^{11}$ M$\_{☉}$, and the central densities are higher than those of any other known galaxy population by 1 order of magnitude. Interestingly, the implied velocity dispersions of {\ensuremath{\sim}}1500 km s$^{‑1}$ are in very good agreement with the measured H{\ensuremath{\beta}} line widths. We suggest that some of the broad lines in ``little red dots'' are not due to AGNs, but simply reflect the kinematics of the galaxies, and speculate that the galaxies are observed in a short-lived phase where the central densities are much higher than at later times. We stress, however, that the canonical interpretation of AGNs causing the broad H{\ensuremath{\beta}} lines also remains viable.}},

    abstract = {{JWST observations have opened a new chapter in supermassive black hole (SMBH) studies, stimulating discussion of two puzzles: the abundance of high-z SMBHs and the fraction of dual active galactic nuclei (AGNs). We argue that the answers to these puzzles may be linked to an interpretation of the data on the nanohertz gravitational waves (GWs) discovered by NANOGrav and other pulsar timing arrays as SMBH binaries whose evolution is driven by interactions with their environments down to O(0.1 pc) separations. We show that the stellar mass-black hole mass correlations found in JWST data and in low-ɀ inactive galaxies are similar, and present a global fit to these data, excluding low-ɀ AGNs. Matching the NANOGrav and dual-AGN data requires that binary evolution due to environmental effects at separations below O(1 kpc) be rapid on cosmological timescales. According to this interpretation, the SMBHs in low-ɀ AGNs are the tip of the iceberg of a local SMBH population in mainly inactive galaxies. This interpretation is consistent with the 'little red dots' observed with JWST being AGNs, and would favour the observability of GW signals from black hole binaries in LISA and decihertz GW detectors.}},

We present one of the highest signal-to-noise ratio JWST NIRSpec prism spectra of a little red dot, J0647\_1045 at z = 4.5319 {\ensuremath{\pm}} 0.0001, and examine its NIRCam morphology to differentiate the origin of the UV and optical/NIR emission and elucidate the nature of the little red dot phenomenon. J0647\_1045 is unresolved (r$\_{e}$ {\ensuremath{\lesssim}} 0.17 kpc) in the three NIRCam long-wavelength filters but significantly extended (r$\_{e}$ = 0.45 {\ensuremath{\pm}} 0.06 kpc) in the three short- wavelength filters, indicating a red compact source in a blue star-forming galaxy. The spectral continuum shows a clear change in slope, from blue in the optical/UV to red in the rest-frame optical/NIR, which is consistent with two distinct components fit by power laws with different attenuations: A$\_{V}$ = 0.38 {\ensuremath{\pm}} 0.01 (UV) and A$\_{V}$ = 5.61 {\ensuremath{\pm}} 0.04 (optical/NIR). Fitting the H{\ensuremath{\alpha}} line requires both broad (full width at half maximum of {\ensuremath{\sim}}4300 {\ensuremath{\pm}} 100 km s$^{‑1}$) and narrow components, but none of the other emission lines, including H{\ensuremath{\beta}}, show evidence of broadness. We calculated A$\_{V}$ = 0.9 {\ensuremath{\pm}} 0.4 from the Balmer decrement using narrow H{\ensuremath{\alpha}} and H{\ensuremath{\beta}} and A$\_{V}$ > 4.1 {\ensuremath{\pm}} 0.1 from broad H{\ensuremath{\alpha}} and an upper limit on broad H{\ensuremath{\beta}}, which is consistent with blue and red continuum attenuation, respectively. Based on a single-epoch H{\ensuremath{\alpha}} line width, the mass of the central black hole is 8$\_{‑0.4}$$^{+0.5}$ {\texttimes} {}10$^{8}$ M$\_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$. Our findings are consistent with a multi-component model, in which the optical/NIR and broad lines arise from a highly obscured, spatially unresolved region, likely a relatively massive active galactic nucleus, while the less obscured UV continuum and narrow lines arise, at least partly, from a small but spatially resolved star-forming host galaxy.}},

Many of these objects exhibit signs of active galactic nucleus (AGN) activity, making their study crucial for understanding the formation of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) and their growth with host galaxies. In this work, we examine low and medium-resolution JWST/NIRSpec spectra from the JADES GTO public data release in the GOODS-N field of a red, luminous (M $\_{B}$ {\ensuremath{\sim}} ‑22.2 mag) and compact (<500 pc) source at z = 4.13. The rest-optical ({\ensuremath{\lambda}} $\_{rest}$ > 4000 {\r{A}}) continuum of this source is strongly dominated by a massive (log$\_{10}$[M $\_{*}$/M $\_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$] {\ensuremath{\sim}} 10.6), quenched (log$\_{10}$[sSFR/yr$^{‑1}$] < ‑11) galaxy, as indicated by the clear presence of a Balmer break and stellar absorption lines. Star formation history modeling reveals a starburst episode followed by rapid quenching about 200 Myr ago. The spectrum shows extremely broad (FWHM {\ensuremath{\sim}}2500 km s$^{‑1}$) H{\ensuremath{\alpha}} emission and elevated optical line ratios, indicating an actively accreting SMBH. Moreover, our work has potentially revealed clear AGN signatures in the rest-UV in little red dots for the first time via the detection of a strong Ly{\ensuremath{\alpha}} emission and a broad Mg II doublet. The derived black hole mass of log$\_{10}$(M $\_{BH}$/M $\_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$) {\ensuremath{\sim}} 7.3 results in M $\_{BH}$/M $\_{*}$ {\ensuremath{\sim}} 0.04\%, consistent with the local relations, unlike the elevated ratios in other high-z reddened AGN. Finally, we use JWST data from AGN at z = 4{\textendash}10 to explore an evolutionary link between high-z reddened AGN, early quiescent galaxies, and local ellipticals.}},

We propose that gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are a powerful probe to explore the origin of the excess and, hence, the star and galaxy formation histories in the early universe. Focusing on the recently launched mission, Einstein Probe (EP), we find that EP can detect several GRBs annually at z {\ensuremath{\gtrsim}} 10, assuming the GRB formation rate calibrated by events at z {\ensuremath{\lesssim}} 6 can be extrapolated. Interestingly, depending on the excess scenarios, the GRB event rate may also show an excess at z ≃ 10, and its detection will help to discriminate between the scenarios that are otherwise difficult to distinguish. Additionally, we discuss that the puzzling, red-color, compact galaxies discovered by JWST, the so-called ``little red dots,'' could host dark GRBs if they are dust-obscured star-forming galaxies. We are eager for unbiased follow-up of GRBs and encourage future missions such as HiZ-GUNDAM to explore the early universe.}},

We examine the morphology of 30 LRDs; the remaining 69 are predominantly compact, i.e. are strongly dominated by sources < 400 pc in diameter and lack extended components even in stacked SW band images. Among the LRDs selected for morphological analysis, 50\% show at least two distinct, associated sources or galaxy components, while the others appear as single sources with highly asymmetric structures.

NIRSpec spectra are available for 15 sources, 6 of which fall within the morphological analysis sample and show multiple components. Among these 15, broad H-alpha emission is detected in 40\%, with full-width half- maximum (FWHM) ranging from 1200 to 2900 km/s. One source exhibits broad H-beta emission with FWHM = 2000 +/- 500 km/s. Analysis of line ratios probing the interstellar medium (ISM) reveals a composite nature, indicating AGN activity combined with stellar processes. These findings suggest LRDs have a mixed nature, with AGN signatures in some cases linked to disturbed morphologies observed at rest-frame UV wavelengths.}},

    abstract = {{Among the most puzzling early discoveries of JWST are ``Little Red Dots'' -- compact red sources that host broad Balmer emission lines and, in many cases, exhibit a ``V shaped'' change in slope in the rest-optical. The physical properties of Little Red Dots currently have order-of-magnitude uncertainties, because models to explain the continuum of these sources differ immensely. Here, we leverage the complete selection of red sources in the RUBIES program, supplemented with public PRISM spectra, to study the origin of this ``V shape''. By fitting a broken power law with a flexible inflection point, we find that a large fraction (20/44, nearly all spatially unresolved) of extremely red H$\alpha$ emitters at $2<z<6$ exhibit a strong change in slope, and that all strong inflections appear associated with the Balmer limit ($0.3645$ $\mu$m). Using a simple model of a reddened AGN with an unobscured scattered light component, we demonstrate that the observed ``V shape'' in Little Red Dots is unlikely to occur at any specific wavelength if the entire continuum is dominated by light from a power law AGN continuum. In contrast, models with an intrinsic feature at the Balmer limit, such as those that are dominated by evolved stellar populations in the rest-UV-to-optical, can produce the observed spectral shapes, provided that a reddened component picks up sufficiently redward of the break. While no model can comfortably explain the full Little Red Dot spectral energy distribution, the common inflection location suggests that it is most likely a single component that consistently dominates the rest-UV-to-optical in Little Red Dots, and that this component is associated with $T\sim10^4$ K hydrogen due to the clear preference for a break at H$\_\infty$.}},

We examine SED models in which either galaxy or active galactic nucleus (AGN) emission dominates the rest-frame UV or optical continuum, extracting physical properties to explore each scenario's implications. In the galaxy-only model, we find massive, dusty stellar populations alongside unobscured, low-mass components, hinting at inhomogeneous obscuration. The AGN-only model indicates dusty, luminous AGNs with low hot dust fractions compared to typical quasars. A hybrid AGN and galaxy model suggests low-mass, unobscured galaxies in the UV, with stellar mass estimates spanning $\sim$2 dex across the different models, underscoring the need for caution in interpreting LRD stellar masses. With MIRI photometry, the galaxy-only model produces stellar masses within cosmological limits, but extremely high stellar mass densities are inferred. The hybrid model infers highly overmassive black holes exceeding those in recently reported high-redshift AGNs, hinting at a partial AGN contribution to the rest-optical continuum or widespread super- Eddington accretion. Our findings highlight the extreme conditions required for both AGN or galaxy dominated scenarios in LRDs, supporting a mixed contribution to the red continuum, or novel scenarios to explain the observed emission.}},

We investigate this phenomenon using General Relativistic Radiation Magnetohydrodynamics simulations of super-Eddington accretion onto a supermassive black hole (SMBH) with M $\_{{\textbullet}}$ = {}10$^{7}$ M $\_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$ at z {\ensuremath{\sim}} 6, representing the median population; the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) that we obtain are intrinsically X-ray weak. The highest levels of X-ray weakness occur in SMBHs accreting at mildly super-Eddington rates (1.4 < f $\_{Edd}$ < 4) with zero spin, viewed at angles >30{\textdegree} from the pole. X-ray bolometric corrections in the observed 2{\textendash}10 keV band reach {\ensuremath{\sim}}{}10$^{4}$ at z = 6, {\ensuremath{\sim}}5 times higher than the highest constraint from X-ray stacking. Most SEDs are extraordinarily steep and soft in the X-rays (median photon index {\ensuremath{\Gamma}} = 3.1, mode of {\ensuremath{\Gamma}} = 4.4). SEDs strong in the X-rays have harder spectra with a high-energy bump when viewed near the hot (>{}10$^{8}$ K) and highly relativistic jet, whereas X-ray weak SEDs lack this feature. Viewing an SMBH within 10{\textdegree} of its pole, where beaming enhances the X-ray emission, has a {\ensuremath{\sim}}1.5\% probability, matching the LRD X-ray detection rate. Next-generation observatories like AXIS will detect X-ray-weak LRDs at z {\ensuremath{\sim}} 6 from any viewing angle. Although many SMBHs in the LRDs are already estimated to accrete at super-Eddington rates, our model explains 50\% of their population by requiring that their masses are overestimated by a mere factor of {\ensuremath{\sim}}3. In summary, we suggest that LRDs host slowly spinning SMBHs accreting at mildly super-Eddington rates, with large covering factors and broad emission lines enhanced by strong winds, providing a self-consistent explanation for their X-ray weakness and complementing other models.}},

The star-to-dust ratio is a factor {\ensuremath{\sim}}100{\texttimes} larger than expected from dust formation models if one assumes the rest-optical light is dominated by stars; this suggests stars do not dominate.

    abstract = {{The James Webb Space Telescope has uncovered a puzzling population of UV-faint broad-line active galactic nuclei (AGN), nicknamed ``Little Red Dots'' (LRD) owing to their compact morphology and red rest-frame optical colours. Interpreted as dust attenuated AGN, their inferred intrinsic luminosities and supermassive black hole (SMBH) masses rival those of UV-luminous quasars, although they are $>100$ times more abundant. If LRDs and quasars are members of the same underlying population, they should inhabit comparable mass dark matter halos, traced by similar overdensities of galaxies. Otherwise, they represent distinct populations with different physical properties and formation histories. Characterizing LRD environments thus provides a critical test of their nature. Here, we report the discovery of a LRD at $z=7.3$, attenuated by moderate amounts of dust, $A\_V = {3.26}\,\rm{mag}$, with an intrinsic bolometric luminosity of $10^{46.7}\,\rm{erg}\,\rm{s}^{-1}$ and a SMBH mass of $7\times10^8\,\rm{M}\_\odot$. Most notably, this object is embedded in an overdensity of eight nearby galaxies, allowing us to calculate the first spectroscopic estimate of the clustering of galaxies around LRDs. We find a LRD-galaxy cross-correlation length of $r\_0\!=\!9\pm2\,\rm{h}^{-1}\,\rm{cMpc}$, comparable to that of $z\!\sim\!6$ UV-luminous quasars. The resulting estimate of their minimum dark matter halo mass of $\log\_{10}(M\_{\rm{halo, min}}/\rm{M}\_{\odot})= 12.3\_{-0.8}^{+0.7}$ indicates that nearly all halos above this mass must host actively accreting SMBHs at $z\approx7$, in strong contrast with the far smaller duty cycle of luminous quasars ($<1\%$). Our results, taken at face value, motivate a picture in which LRDs are the obscured counterparts of UV- luminous quasars, which provides a natural explanation for the short UV-luminous lifetimes inferred from both quasar clustering and quasar proximity zones.}},

The discovery highlights the presence of dust-reddened AGN populations, referred to as ``little red dots (LRDs),'' more abundant than X-ray-selected AGNs, which are less influenced by obscuration. This finding indicates that the cosmic growth rate of BHs within this population does not decrease but rather increases at higher redshifts beyond z {\ensuremath{\sim}} 6. The BH accretion rate density deduced from their luminosity function is remarkably higher than that from other AGN surveys in X-ray and infrared bands. To align the cumulative mass density accreted to BHs with the observed BH mass density at z ≃ 4{\textendash}5, as derived from the integration of the BH mass function, the radiative efficiency must be doubled from the canonical 10\% value, achieving significance beyond the >3{\ensuremath{\sigma}} confidence level. This suggests the presence of rapid spins with 96\% of the maximum limit among these BHs under the thin-disk approximation, maintained by prolonged mass accretion instead of chaotic accretion with randomly oriented inflows. Moreover, we derive an upper bound for the stellar mass of galaxies hosting these LRDs, ensuring consistency with galaxy formation in the standard cosmological model, where the host stellar mass is limited by the available baryonic reservoir. Our analysis gives a lower bound for the BH- to-galaxy mass ratio that exceeds the typical value known in the nearby universe and aligns with that for JWST-detected unobscured AGNs. Accordingly, we propose a hypothesis that the dense, dust-rich environments within LRDs facilitate the emergence of rapidly spinning and overmassive BH populations during the epoch of reionization. This scenario predicts a potential association between relativistic jets and other high- energy phenomena with overmassive BHs in the early universe.}},

We analyze 434 known LRDs from the 0.54 ${\rm deg}^2$ COSMOS-Web survey and test the hypothesis that they originated from SMPBHs assuming sub-Eddington accretion.

    abstract = {{Recent James Webb Space Telescope observations have revealed a population of compact extragalactic objects at z {\ensuremath{\gtrsim}} 4 with red near-infrared colors, which have been dubbed as ``Little Red Dots'' (LRDs). The spectroscopically selected LRDs exhibit broad H{\ensuremath{\alpha}} emission lines, which likely indicate that type I active galactic nuclei (AGNs) are harbored in the galaxies' dust-reddened cores. However, other mechanisms, like strong outflowing winds, could also produce broad H{\ensuremath{\alpha}} emission lines, and thus, the nature of LRDs is still under debate. We test the AGN hypothesis for LRDs by stacking the archival Chandra observations of 34 spectroscopically selected LRDs. We obtain tentative detections in the soft (0.5{\textendash}2 keV) and hard (2{\textendash}8 keV) X-ray bands with 2.9{\ensuremath{\sigma}} and 3.2{\ensuremath{\sigma}} significance, and with 4.1{\ensuremath{\sigma}} significance when combining the two bands. Nevertheless, we find that the soft (hard) band 3{\ensuremath{\sigma}} upper limit is {\ensuremath{\sim}}1 dex ({\ensuremath{\sim}}0.3 dex) lower than the expected level from the L $\_{X}${\textendash}L $\_{H{\ensuremath{\alpha}} }$ relation for typical type I AGNs. Our results indicate that AGN activity is indeed likely present in LRDs though these objects have significantly different properties compared to previously identified type I AGNs, i.e., LRDs may have intrinsically weak X-ray emissions. We find it difficult to explain the low L $\_{X}$/L $\_{H{\ensuremath{\alpha}} }$ ratios observed in LRDs solely by absorption. It is also unlikely that fast outflows have major contributions to the broad H{\ensuremath{\alpha}} lines. Our findings indicate that empirical relations (e.g., for black hole mass measurements) established for typical type I AGNs should be used with caution when analyzing the properties of LRDs.}},

The rest-frame UV cannot be explained by a dusty quasar component alone and requires an additional blue component consistent with either a star-forming host galaxy or scattered AGN light. We detect broad high-ionization emission lines in the rest-UV, supporting the scattered light interpretation for the UV excess. The scattering fraction represents just 0.05 per cent of the total luminosity of ULASJ2315+0143 . Analysis of the mid- infrared SED suggests an absence of hot dust on torus-scales similar to what is observed for LRDs. The obscuring medium is therefore likely on galaxy scales. We detect narrow, blueshifted associated absorption-line systems in C IV, N V, Si IV, and Si III.

Given their extreme red colouring in the observed frame these galaxies have been dubbed Little Red Dots (LRDs). The aim of this project was to identify LRDs using photometric data from previously uninvestigated JWST datasets and to estimate their AGN fractions by fitting the spectral energy distribution of each galaxy against well calibrated templates using CIGALE. We identified a list of potential LRDs using a single colour cut of F444W-F277W $>$1.5 mag and by applying a morphological analysis. We used EAZY to estimate the (photometric) redshift and CIGALE to estimate the AGN fraction of each LRD. Overall, we identified 14 LRDs, applying accurate SED fits to 11 of them. We found that 7 of them had a high AGN fraction (with the AGN component generating more than 50\textbackslash\% of the observed flux), a further two LRDs had AGN contribution in excess of approximately 40\textbackslash\%. In total nine LRDs (our of 14) are likely to have a supermassive black hole in their centre. Interestingly, the three LRDs which could not be well fit by CIGALE displayed extremely high photometric redshifts ($z\_{phot} rsim 11$) and require further analysis (and may also host a supermassive black hole in their centre).}},

As a proof of concept, we apply mephisto to the latest data from the James Webb Space Telescope. mephisto attains near-human proficiency in reasoning about galaxies' physical scenarios, even when dealing with a recently discovered population of ``Little Red Dot'' galaxies.

This population includes a subset known as 'Little Red Dots', characterized by their compact morphology and extremely red rest-frame optical colors. If all of these broad H$\alpha$ emitters were attributed to type $1-1.9$ Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs), it would imply a significantly higher number density of low-luminosity AGNs than extrapolated from that of more luminous AGNs. Here, we have examined the rest-frame ultraviolet (UV)-optical flux variability of five JWST broad H$\alpha$ emitters using multi-epoch, multi-band JWST/NIRCam imaging data. The rest-frame temporal sampling interval of the NIRCam data ($\sim 400-500$\raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitildedays$/(1+z)$) is comparable to typical variability timescales of AGNs with black hole (BH) masses of $M\_{\text{BH}} \sim 10^{7}\textasciitilde M\_{\odot}$; thus, the flux variations should be detectable if AGNs were present. However, no measurable flux variation over the rest-frame wavelength range of $\lambda\_{\text{rest}} \sim 1,500-9,000${\r{A}} has been detected, placing stringent upper limits on the variability amplitudes. This result, combined with the X-ray faintness confirmed by the ultra-deep \{\textbackslashit Chandra\} data, indicates that, under the AGN scenario, we need to postulate peculiar Compton-thick broad-line AGNs with either ($a$) an intrinsically non-variable AGN disk continuum, ($b$) a host galaxy-dominated continuum, or ($c$) scattering-dominated AGN emission. Alternatively, ($d$) they could be non-AGNs where the broad-line emission originates from unusually fast and dense/low-metallicity star-formation-driven outflows or inelastic Raman scattering of stellar UV continua by neutral hydrogen atoms.}},

A substellar Galactic nature is deemed unlikely, given that the Cerberus's relatively flat NIRCam-to-NIRCam and very red NIRCam-to-MIRI flux ratios are not consistent with any brown dwarf model.

    abstract = {{The origins and mergers of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) remain a mystery. We describe a scenario from a novel multiphysics simulation featuring rapid ({\ensuremath{\lesssim}}1 Myr) hyper- Eddington gas capture by a {\ensuremath{\sim}}1000 M $\_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$ ``seed'' black hole (BH) up to supermassive ({\ensuremath{\gtrsim}}{}10$^{6}$ M $\_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$) masses in a massive, dense molecular cloud complex typical of high-redshift starbursts. Due to the high cloud density, stellar feedback is inefficient, and most of the gas turns into stars in star clusters that rapidly merge hierarchically, creating deep potential wells. Relatively low- mass BH seeds at random positions can be ``captured'' by merging subclusters and migrate to the center in {\ensuremath{\sim}}1 freefall time (vastly faster than dynamical friction). This also efficiently produces a paired BH binary with {\ensuremath{\sim}}0.1 pc separation. The centrally concentrated stellar density profile (akin to a ``protobulge'') allows the cluster as a whole to capture and retain gas and build up a large (parsec-scale) circumbinary accretion disk with gas coherently funneled to the central BH (even when the BH radius of influence is small). The disk is ``hypermagnetized'' and ``flux-frozen'': dominated by a toroidal magnetic field with plasma {\ensuremath{\beta}} {\ensuremath{\sim}} 10$^{‑3}$, with the fields amplified by flux-freezing. This drives hyper- Eddington inflow rates {\ensuremath{\gtrsim}}1 M $\_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$ yr$^{‑1}$, which also drive the two BHs to nearly equal masses. The late-stage system appears remarkably similar to recently observed high-redshift ``little red dots.'' This scenario can provide an explanation for rapid SMBH formation, growth, and mergers in high-redshift galaxies.}},

    abstract = {{The discovery of Little Red Dots (LRDs){\textemdash}a population of compact, high-redshift, dust-reddened galaxies{\textemdash}is one of the most surprising results from JWST. However, the nature of LRDs is still debated: does the near-infrared emission originate from accreting supermassive black holes (SMBHs), or intense star formation? In this work, we utilize ultra-deep Chandra observations and study LRDs residing behind the lensing galaxy cluster, A2744. We probe the X-ray emission from individual galaxies but find that they remain undetected and provide SMBH mass upper limits of {\ensuremath{\lesssim}}(1.5{\textendash}16) {\texttimes} {}10$^{6}$ M $\_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$ assuming Eddington limited accretion. To increase the signal-to-noise ratios, we conduct a stacking analysis of the full sample with a total lensed exposure time of {\ensuremath{\approx}}87 Ms. We also bin the galaxies based on their stellar mass, lensing magnification, and detected broad-line H{\ensuremath{\alpha}} emission. For the LRDs exhibiting broad-line H{\ensuremath{\alpha}} emission, there is a hint of a stacked signal ({\ensuremath{\sim}}2.6{\ensuremath{\sigma}}), corresponding to an SMBH mass of {\ensuremath{\sim}}3.2 {\texttimes} {}10$^{6}$ M $\_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$. Assuming unobscured, Eddington- limited accretion, this black hole (BH) mass is at least 1.5 orders of magnitude lower than that inferred from virial mass estimates using JWST spectra. Given galaxy-dominated stellar mass estimates, our results imply that LRDs do not host overmassive SMBHs and/or accrete at a few percent of their Eddington limit. However, alternative stellar mass estimates may still support that LRDs host overmassive BHs. The significant discrepancy between the JWST and Chandra data hints that the scaling relations used to infer the SMBH mass from the H{\ensuremath{\alpha}} line and virial relations may not be applicable for high-redshift LRDs.}},

Virgil is a Lyman-$\alpha$ emitter (LAE) at $z\_{spec} = 6.6312\pm 0.0019$ (from VLT/MUSE) with a rest-frame UV-to-optical spectral energy distribution (SED) typical of LAEs at similar redshifts. However, MIRI observations reveal an unexpected extremely red color at rest-frame near-infrared wavelengths, $\rm F444W - F1000W = 2.33 \pm 0.06$. Such steep rise in the near-infrared, completely missed without MIRI imaging, is poorly reproduced by models including only stellar populations and hints towards the presence of an Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN). According to the shape of its overall SED, Virgil belongs to the recently discovered population of Little Red Dots (LRDs) but displays an extended rest-frame UV-optical wavelengths morphology following a 2D-S{\'e}rsic profile with average index $n = 0.93^{+0.85}\_{-0.31}$ and $r\_e = 0.49^{+0.05}\_{-0.11}$ pkpc. Only at MIRI wavelengths Virgil is unresolved due to the coarser PSF. We also estimate a bolometric luminosity $L\_{\rm bol, AGN} = (8.9-11)\times 10^{44}\rm\textasciitilde erg\textasciitilde s^{-1}$ and a supermassive black hole mass $M\_{\rm BH} = (7-9)\times 10^6\rm \textasciitilde\ M\_\odot$ (if $\lambda\_{\rm Edd} = 1$) in agreement with recently reported values for LRDs. This discovery demonstrates the crucial importance of deep MIRI surveys to find AGN amongst high-$z$ galaxies that otherwise would be completely missed and raises the question of how common Virgil-like objects could be in the early Universe.}},

These objects are key to our understanding of the formation of supermassive black holes (SMBHs), their coevolution with host galaxies, as well as the role of AGN in cosmic reionization. Using photometric colors and size measurements, we perform a search for compact red objects in an array of blank deep JWST/NIRCam fields totaling {\ensuremath{\sim}}640 arcmin$^{2}$. Our careful selection yields 260 reddened AGN candidates at 4 < z $\_{phot}$ < 9, dominated by a point-source-like central component ({\ensuremath{\langle}}r $\_{eff}${\ensuremath{\rangle}} < 130 pc) and displaying a dichotomy in their rest-frame colors (blue UV and red optical slopes).

Thanks to the large areas explored, we extend the existing dusty AGN luminosity functions to both fainter and brighter magnitudes, estimating their number densities to be {\texttimes}100 higher than for UV-selected quasars of similar magnitudes. At the same time, they constitute only a small fraction of all UV-selected galaxies at similar redshifts, but this percentage rises to {\ensuremath{\sim}}10\% for M $\_{UV}$ {\ensuremath{\sim}} ‑ 22 at z {\ensuremath{\sim}} 7.

We significantly measure older stellar populations in the LRDs out to rest-frame 3 {\ensuremath{\mu}}m (the stellar bump) and rule out a dominant contribution from hot dust emission, a signature of AGN contamination to stellar population measurements. This allows us to measure their contribution to the cosmic census at z > 3, below the typical detection limits of ALMA (L $\_{IR}$ < 10$^{12 }$ L $\_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$). We find that these sources, which are overwhelmingly missed by HST and ALMA, could effectively double the obscured fraction of the star formation rate density at 4 < z < 6 compared to some estimates, showing that prior to JWST, the obscured contribution from fainter sources could be underestimated. Finally, we identify five sources with evidence for Balmer breaks and high stellar masses at 5.5 < z < 7.7.

We present a sample of 434 ``little red dots'' (LRDs), selected from the 0.54 deg$^2$ COSMOS-Web survey. We fit galaxy and AGN SED models to derive redshifts and physical properties; the sample spans $z\sim5$-$9$ after removing brown dwarf contaminants. We consider two extreme physical scenarios: either LRDs are all AGN, and their continuum emission is dominated by the accretion disk, or they are all compact star-forming galaxies, and their continuum is dominated by stars. If LRDs are AGN-dominated, our sample exhibits bolometric luminosities $\sim10^{45-47}$ erg\textbackslash,s$^{-1}$, spanning the gap between JWST AGN in the literature and bright, rare quasars. We derive a bolometric luminosity function (LF) $\sim100$ times the (UV-selected) quasar LF, implying a non-evolving black hole accretion density of $\sim10^{-4}$ M$\_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-3}$ from $z\sim2$-$9$. By contrast, if LRDs are dominated by star formation, we derive stellar masses $\sim10^{8.5-10}\,M\_\odot$. MIRI/F770W is key to deriving accurate stellar masses; without it, we derive a mass function inconsistent with $\Lambda$CDM. The median stellar mass profile is broadly consistent with the maximal stellar mass surface densities seen in the nearby universe, though the most massive $\sim50$\textbackslash\% of objects exceed this limit, requiring substantial AGN contribution to the continuum. Nevertheless, stacking all available X-ray, mid-IR, far-IR/sub-mm, and radio data yields non-detections. Whether dominated by dusty AGN, compact star-formation, or both, the high masses/luminosities and remarkable abundance of LRDs implies a dominant mode of early galaxy/SMBH growth.}},

With JWST/NIRCam imaging, we determine the UV continua with M $\_{UV}$ ranging from ‑20.5 to ‑18.5 mag. The UV slopes have a median value of {\ensuremath{\beta}} {\ensuremath{\approx}} ‑2.35, and the steepest slopes can reach {\ensuremath{\beta}} < ‑3. Under the excellent spatial resolution of JWST, we identify three objects in the sample as potential merging/interacting systems. The 14 LAEs (and their components) are compact in morphology, residing substantially below the mass{\textendash}size relation of high-z galaxies. We further investigate their physical properties, including the stellar mass (M $\_{*}$) and star formation rates (SFRs). Most of the LAEs lie on the SFR{\textendash}M $\_{*}$ main-sequence relation, while two of them, featured as ``little red dots,'' likely host active galactic nuclei (AGNs), implying a {\ensuremath{\sim}}10\% AGN fraction. Moreover, we reveal that a new correlation may exist between Ly{\ensuremath{\alpha}} equivalent width and the offset between Ly{\ensuremath{\alpha}} and UV emission ({\ensuremath{\Delta}}d $\_{Ly{\ensuremath{\alpha}} }$), with a median {\ensuremath{\Delta}}d $\_{Ly{\ensuremath{\alpha}} }$ {\ensuremath{\sim}} 1 kpc. This could be explained by the Ly{\ensuremath{\alpha}} radiative transfer process in both the interstellar medium and circumgalactic medium. The results usher in a new era of detailed analysis on high-z LAEs with the JWST capability.}},

The number density discrepancy is much lower when compared to the broad H{\ensuremath{\alpha}} LF. The SMBH mass function agrees with large cosmological simulations. In two objects, we detect complex H{\ensuremath{\alpha}} profiles that we tentatively interpret as caused by absorption signatures from dense gas fueling SMBH growth and outflows. We may be witnessing early AGN feedback that will clear dust-free pathways through which more massive blue quasars are seen. We uncover a strong correlation between reddening and the fraction of total galaxy luminosity arising from faint AGN. This implies that early SMBH growth is highly obscured and that faint AGN are only minor contributors to cosmic reionization.}},

Recently, a NIRCam-selected sample of little red dots over 45 arcmin$^{2}$ has been followed up with deep NIRSpec multiobject prism spectroscopy through the UNCOVER program. By investigating the acquired spectra, we identify 3 of the 14 followed-up objects as T/Y dwarfs with temperatures between 650 and 1300 K and distances between 0.8 and 4.8 kpc. At ${4.8}\_{-0.1}^{+0.6}$ kpc, A2744-BD1 is the most distant brown dwarf discovered to date. We identify the remaining 11 objects as extragalactic sources at z $\_{spec}$ {\ensuremath{\gtrsim}} 5. Given that three of these sources are strongly lensed images of the same AGN (A2744-QSO1), we derive a brown dwarf contamination fraction of 25\% in this NIRCam selection of little red dots. We find that in the near-infrared filters, brown dwarfs appear much bluer than the highly reddened AGN, providing an avenue for distinguishing the two and compiling cleaner samples of photometrically selected highly reddened AGN.}},

A comparison of the average SEDs between our sample and LRDs selected in the same field reveals that the steep red slopes observed in some LRDs are likely due to line- boosting effects as previously suggested. Furthermore, we find that 68\% of color-selected LRDs with H$α$ detections in the NIRCam/Grism spectra do not exhibit broad-line features.

    abstract = {{A significant fraction of little red dots (LRDs) exhibit nearby extended emission of unknown origin. If physically associated with the LRD, this component may trace stellar emission from an off- centered host galaxy, neighboring companions, or nebular gas illuminated by the active nucleus. We investigate the detailed spectral energy distribution of the extended emission near four LRDs in the JWST UNCOVER and MegaScience surveys. We accurately decompose the extended emission from the dominant point source by simultaneously fitting the images in eight broad-band and nine medium-band filters. After considering both the results from photometric redshift fitting and the probability of galaxies at different redshift overlapping, we confirm that the off-centered blobs in three sources are physically associated with the LRDs, with two of them showing strong [\textbackslashion\{O\}\{3\}] $λλ4959,\,5007$ emission captured by the medium-band filters. While the spectral energy distributions of all three blobs can be modeled assuming star- forming galaxies with stellar mass $\sim 10^8\,M\_{\odot}$, the exceptionally strong [\textbackslashion\{O\}\{3\}] emission of two sources is best interpreted as pure nebular emission from low-density ($n<10\, {\rm cm}^{-3}$), low-metallicity ($Z\approx 0.05\,Z\_{\odot}$) gas photoionized by the ultraviolet radiation from the nearby LRD. Adopting LRD halo masses constrained by clustering measurements and theoretical considerations, we estimate a typical baryonic halo mass accretion rate of $\sim 2-9\, M\_{\odot}\,{\rm yr}^{-1}$. If the halo accretion rate is sustained to $z=4$ and stars form with an efficiency of 10\textbackslash\%, the accreted gas would form a galaxy with stellar mass $\sim 10^9\,M\_{\odot}$, potentially rendering them spatially resolved at lower redshift.}},

    abstract = {{We present CAPERS-LRD-z9, a little red dot (LRD) which we confirm to be a $z=9.288$ broad-line AGN (BLAGN). First identified as a high- redshift LRD candidate from PRIMER NIRCam photometry, follow-up NIRSpec/PRISM spectroscopy of CAPERS-LRD-z9 from the CANDELS- Area Prism Epoch of Reionization Survey (CAPERS) has revealed a broad $3500$ km s$^{-1}$ H$β$ emission line and narrow [O III]$λ\lambda4959,5007$ lines, indicative of a BLAGN. Based on the broad H$β$ line, we compute a canonical black-hole mass of $\log(M\_{\textrm{BH}}/M\_{\odot})=7.58\pm0.15$, although full consideration of systematic uncertainties yields a conservative range of $6.65<\log(M\_{\textrm{BH}}/M\_{\odot})<8.50$. These observations suggest that either a massive black hole seed, or a lighter stellar remnant seed undergoing periods of super- Eddington accretion, is necessary to grow such a massive black hole in $\lesssim500$ Myr of cosmic time. CAPERS-LRD-z9 exhibits a strong Balmer break, consistent with a central AGN surrounded by dense ($\sim 10^{10}\textrm{ cm}^{-3}$) neutral gas. We model CAPERS-LRD-z9 using CLOUDY to fit the emission red-ward of the Balmer break with a dense gas-enshrouded AGN, and bagpipes to fit the rest-ultraviolet emission as a host-galaxy stellar population. This upper limit on the stellar mass of the host galaxy ($<10^9\,{\rm M\_\odot}$) implies that the black-hole to stellar mass ratio may be extremely large, possibly $>5\%$ (although systematic uncertainties on the black-hole mass prevent strong conclusions). However, the shape of the UV continuum differs from typical high-redshift star-forming galaxies, indicating that this UV emission may also be of AGN origin, and hence the true stellar mass of the host may be still lower.}},

    abstract = {{Little red dots (LRDs) are a newly identified class of broad-line active galactic nuclei (AGN) with a distinctive v-shape spectrum characterized by red optical and blue UV continuum emission. Their high abundance at redshifts of $z\sim6-8$ and decline at lower redshifts suggest a transient origin. We propose that the spectral shape of LRDs originates from compact binary black hole systems, where each black hole is surrounded by a mini-disk and embedded in a larger circum-binary disk. With a binary separation of $\lesssim 10^3$ Schwarzschild radii, the Wien tail of a $T\simeq 5000\textasciitilde {\rm K}$ blackbody spectrum at the inner edge of the circum-binary disk produces the red optical emission, while the mini-disks power the UV continuum. Binary torques carve out a gap between the circum-binary disk and mini-disks, setting the turnover wavelength of the v-shaped spectrum around the Balmer limit. This scenario naturally reproduces LRD spectra requiring only modest dust attenuation ($A\_V\lesssim 1$ mag), resolving overestimated luminosities for LRDs in previous studies and alleviating a tension with the so-called Soltan argument. This model predicts a distinct spectral evolution as the binary orbit decays through binary-disk interactions and gravitational waves (GWs), linking early-stage ``proto-LRD'' binaries to the broader AGN population and late-stage ``LRD- descendants'' to coalescing binaries detectable in GW experiments.}},

    abstract = {{The JWST has uncovered a new population of candidate broad-line active galactic nucleus (AGN) emerging in the early Universe, named 'little red dots' (LRDs) because of their compactness and red colours at optical wavelengths. LRDs appear to be surprisingly abundant (<inline-formula><tex-math>${\approx} 10^{-5} \, {\rm cMpc}^{-3}$</tex-math></inline-formula>) given that their inferred bolometric luminosities largely overlap with those of the ultraviolet (UV)-luminous quasars identified at high z in wide-field spectroscopic surveys. In this work, we investigate how the population of LRDs and/or other UV-obscured AGN relates to the one of unobscured, UV-selected quasars. By comparing their number densities, we infer an extremely large and rapidly evolving obscured:unobscured ratio, ranging from <inline- formula><tex-math>${\approx} 20{:}1$</tex-math></inline-formula> at <inline-formula><tex-math>$z\approx 4$</tex-math></inline- formula> to <inline-formula><tex-math>${\approx} 2300{:}1$</tex- math></inline-formula> at <inline-formula><tex-math>$z\approx 7$</tex-math></inline-formula>, and possibly extending out to very high (<inline-formula><tex-math>${\approx} 10^{47}\, {\rm erg}\, {\rm s}^{-1}$</tex-math></inline-formula>) bolometric luminosities. This large obscured:unobscured ratio is incompatible with the UV-luminous duty cycle measured for unobscured quasars at <inline-formula><tex-math>$z\approx 4\!-\!6$</tex-math></inline-formula>, suggesting that LRDs are too abundant to be hosted by the same haloes as unobscured quasars. This implies that either (a) the bolometric luminosities of LRDs are strongly overestimated or (b) LRDs follow different scaling relations than those of UV-selected quasars, representing a new population of accreting supermassive black holes emerging in the early Universe. A direct comparison between the clustering of LRDs and that of faint UV-selected quasars will ultimately confirm these findings and shed light on key properties of LRDs such as their host mass distribution and duty cycle. We provide a mock analysis for the clustering of LRDs and show that it is feasible with current and upcoming JWST surveys.}},

We present new grid-based hydrodynamics simulations, performed with the binary on the grid and a locally isothermal equation of state, in which the binary is seen to functionally ``stop accreting'' if the orbital Mach number in the disk exceeds a threshold value of about 40. Above this threshold, the disk continues to extract angular momentum from the binary orbit, but it delivers very little mass to the black holes and instead piles up mass in a ring surrounding the binary. This ring will eventually become viscously relaxed and deliver mass to the binary at the large-scale inflow rate. However, we show that the timescale for such relaxation can far exceed the implied binary lifetime. We demonstrate that the ability of a binary{\textendash}disk system to equilibrate is dependent on the efficiency at which accretion streams deposit mass onto the binary, which, in turn is highly sensitive to the thermodynamic conditions of the inner disk. If disks around massive black hole binaries do operate in such nonaccreting regimes, it suggests these systems may be dimmer than their single black hole counterparts but could exhibit dramatic rebrightening after the black holes inspiral and merge. This dimming begins in the UV/optical and could completely choke high-energy emission, such that these systems would likely be intrinsically X-ray weak with reddened continua, potentially resembling the spectra of ``little red dots'' recently identified in JWST observations.}},

We develop a new joint galaxy and active galactic nucleus (AGN) model within the Prospector Bayesian inference framework and perform spectrophotometric modeling using NIRCam, MIRI, and NIRSpec/Prism observations. Our fiducial model reveals a M$\_{*}$ {\ensuremath{\sim}} {}10$^{9}$ M$\_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$ galaxy alongside a dust-reddened AGN driving the optical emission. Explaining the rest-frame optical color as a reddened AGN requires A$\_{V}$ {\ensuremath{\gtrsim}} 3, suggesting that a great majority of the accretion disk energy is reradiated as dust emission. Yet, despite clear AGN signatures, we find a surprising lack of hot torus emission, which implies that either the dust emission in this object must be cold, or the red continuum must instead be driven by a massive, evolved stellar population of the host galaxy{\textemdash}seemingly inconsistent with the high-EW broad lines (H{\ensuremath{\alpha}} rest-frame EW {\ensuremath{\sim}} 800 {\r{A}}). The widths and luminosities of Pa-{\ensuremath{\beta}}, Pa-{\ensuremath{\delta}}, Pa-{\ensuremath{\gamma}}, and H{\ensuremath{\alpha}} imply a modest black hole mass of M$\_{BH}$ {\ensuremath{\sim}} {}10$^{8}$ M$\_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$. Additionally, we identify a narrow blueshifted He I {\ensuremath{\lambda}} 1.083 {\ensuremath{\mu}}m absorption feature in NIRSpec/G395M spectra, signaling an ionized outflow with kinetic energy up to {\ensuremath{\sim}}1\% the luminosity of the AGN. The low redshift of RUBIES-BLAGN-1, combined with the depth and richness of the JWST imaging and spectroscopic observations, provides a unique opportunity to build a physical model for these so-far mysterious LRDs, which may prove to be a crucial phase in the early formation of massive galaxies and their supermassive black holes.}},

    abstract = {{I hypothesize a physical explanation for the ``little red dots'' (LRDs) discovered by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). The first star formation in the Universe occurs in dense clusters, some of which may undergo runaway collapse and form an intermediate mass black hole. This process would appear as a very dense stellar system, with recurring tidal disruption events (TDEs) as stellar material is accreted by the black hole. Such a system would be compact, UV-emitting, and exhibit broad H{\ensuremath{\alpha}} emission. If runaway collapse is the primary mechanism for forming massive black hole seeds, this process could be fairly common and explain the large volume densities of LRDs. In order to match the predicted number density of runaway collapse clusters, the tidal disruption rate must be on the order of 10$^{‑4}$ per year. A top-heavy stellar initial mass function may be required to match observations without exceeding the predicted {\ensuremath{\Lambda}}CDM mass function. The TDE LRD hypothesis can be verified with follow-up JWST observations looking for TDE-like variability.}},

    abstract = {{The dwarf spheroidal galaxy, Segue 1, is thought to have one of the largest ratios of dark matter to stellar mass. Using orbit-based dynamical models, we model Segue 1, including a dark halo and a central black hole. The best-fit model requires a black hole mass of $4 \pm 1.5 \times 10^5\ M\_\odot$. The value of the black hole mass is the same with or without a dark halo. The mass-to- light ratio of the stars is poorly constrained by the dynamical modeling, reflecting that Segue 1 is dominated by mass other than stars. Dynamical models that exclude a black hole provide a worse fit and require a dark halo with very small scale radii of around 100 parsecs. Additionally, the zero black hole models require a stellar orbital distribution that is highly radially biased. The model with a black hole provides an orbital structure that is close to isotropic, more similar to other well-studied systems. We argue that the two-parameter models of stars and black hole provide a better description of Segue 1 than the three-parameter models of stars and two dark halo components. Additional support for a central black hole comes from a significant increase in the central rotation. Using individual velocities, we measure a rotation amplitude of $9.0 \pm 2.4\ \mathrm{km\ s^{-1}}$. Segue 1 is likely being tidally stripped at large radii, and we might be witnessing the remnant nucleus of a more massive system. Alternatively, given the high black hole mass relative to the stellar mass, Segue 1 is analogous to Little Red Dots seen in the early Universe.}},

The origin of both classes of objects remains uncertain but is likely linked to the formation and early growth of the first massive black holes (MBHs), which may be more easily explained by invoking phases of super-Eddington accretion. In this study, we use a state-of-the- art zoom-in cosmological simulation of a quasar host to investigate whether these objects, during their assembly, can resemble any of the peculiar sources observed with JWST. We find that the impact of MBH feedback on star formation is typically moderate, with outflows preferentially escaping perpendicular to the galactic disc. However, for approximately ten percent of the galaxy's lifetime, the system enters a distinct quenched phase, after a rapid MBH growth driven by super-Eddington accretion. This phase culminates in a powerful feedback event, during which the MBH jet and disc-driven winds interact directly with the galactic disc, carving out a central cavity. We also find that, during the history of the quasar host progenitor, the spectral properties of the system can resemble both LRDs and quenched galaxies, depending on the specific evolutionary stage considered. These findings suggest that both conditions may represent transient phases in the life cycle of high-redshift galaxies.}},

    abstract = {{JWST spectroscopy has built large emission line samples at $zrsim4$, but it has yet to confidently reveal many galaxies with the hard radiation fields commonly associated with AGN photoionization. While this may indicate a weaker UV ionizing spectrum in many $z>4$ AGNs or obscuration from dense neutral gas and dust, the complete picture remains unclear owing to the small number of deep rest-UV spectra. Here we characterize the strength of high ionization lines in $53$ new galaxies observed with NIRSpec $R=2700$ grating spectroscopy. We present new detections of narrow NV$\lambda1240$ in two galaxies. One is a previously- confirmed $z=6.98$ Little Red Dot (LRD) with broad H$β$, and the other is a $z=8.72$ galaxy with a narrow line spectrum. Neither source exhibits CIV or HeII emission, indicating large NV/CIV and NV/HeII ratios that may reflect a combination of nitrogen- enhancement and resonant scattering effects. We investigate the incidence of narrow high ionization lines in a large database of $851$ NIRSpec grating spectra, and we separately quantify the fraction of LRDs with narrow high ionization UV emission lines. Our results likely suggest that hard radiation fields are indeed present in a small subset of LRDs ($12.5^{+23.7}\_{-10.4}\%$) and UV-selected galaxies ($2.2^{+1.7}\_{-1.0}\%$) at $z>4$. The identification of narrow high ionization lines in the population of LRDs with strong Balmer absorption suggests the dense neutral hydrogen gas may not uniformly cover the nucleus. The NV/CIV and NV/HeII ratios suggest that efforts to identify high ionization lines should extend down in wavelength to the NV doublet.}},

    abstract = {{Recent observations by the James Webb Space Telescope have uncovered a population of compact, red object ($z\sim 4\text{--}7$) known as little red dots (LRDs). The presence of broad Balmer emission lines indicates active galactic nuclei powered by supermassive black holes (BHs), while LRDs exhibit unusually weak X-ray and radio emission and low variability, suggesting super-Eddington accretion that obscures the central engine. We suggest that such an extreme accretion disc inevitably drives strong outflows, which would disrupt the LRDs themselves unless confined within the nuclear region -- posing a general feedback problem for overmassive BHs. To resolve this, we propose that the BH is embedded in a massive, optically thick envelope that gravitationally confines the outflow, making any outflow a no- go. This envelope, powered by accretion on to the BH, radiates at nearly the Eddington limit, and is sustained by an infall of the interstellar medium at a rate on the order of $\sim 1 M\_{\odot}\textasciitilde {\rm yr}^{-1}$. A photosphere emerges either within the envelope or in the infalling medium, with a characteristic temperature of $5000$ - $7000 {\rm K}$, near the Hayashi limit. The resulting blackbody emission naturally explains the red optical continuum of the distinct V-shaped spectrum observed in most LRDs. Furthermore, the dynamical time-scale at the photosphere, $\sim 0.01\textasciitilde {\rm pc}$, is consistent with the observed year-scale variabilities. The nuclear structure and spectral features of LRDs are shaped by this envelope, which not only regulates feedback but also acts as a gas reservoir that sustains rapid BH growth in the early universe.}},

    abstract = {{The abundant population of ``Little Red Dots'' (LRDs)-compact objects with red UV to optical colors and broad Balmer lines at high redshift-is unveiling new insights into the properties of early active galactic nuclei (AGN). Perhaps the most surprising features of this population are the presence of Balmer absorption and ubiquitous strong Balmer breaks. Recent models link these features to an active supermassive black hole (SMBH) cocooned in very dense gas ($N\_{\rm H}\sim10^{24}\,\rm cm^{-2}$). We present a stringent test of such models using VLT/MUSE observations of A2744-45924, the most luminous LRD known to date ($L\_{\rm Hα}\approx10^{44}\textasciitilde \rm erg\,s^{-1}$), located behind the Abell-2744 lensing cluster at $z=4.464$ ($μ=1.8$). We detect a moderately extended Ly$α$ nebula ($h\approx5.7$ pkpc), spatially offset from the point-like H$α$ seen by JWST. The Ly$α$ emission is narrow ($\rm FWHM=270\pm 15\textasciitilde km\,s^{-1}$), spatially offset to H$α$, and faint ($\rm Lyα=0.07Hα$) compared to Ly$α$ nebulae typically observed around quasars of similar luminosity. We detect compact N$\,$IV]$λ$1486 emission, spatially aligned with H$α$, and a spatial shift in the far-UV continuum matching the Ly$α$ offset. We discuss that H$α$ and Ly$α$ have distinct physical origins: H$α$ originates from the AGN, while Ly$α$ is powered by star formation. In the environment of A2744-45924, we identify four extended Ly$α$ halos ($Δz<0.02$, $Δr<100$ pkpc). Their Ly$α$ luminosities match expectations based on H$α$ emission, indicating no evidence for radiation from A2744-45924 affecting its surroundings. The lack of strong, compact, and broad Ly$α$ and the absence of a luminous extended halo, suggest that the UV AGN light is obscured by dense gas cloaking the SMBH with covering factor close to unity.}},

Based on broad-line diagnostics, these galaxies have been argued to host accreting $10^7-10^8$ M$\_\odot$ supermassive black holes (SMBHs), a claim with crucial consequences for our understanding of how the first black holes form and grow over cosmic time. A key feature of LRDs is their extreme X-ray weakness: analyses of individual and stacked sources have yielded non-detections or only tentative, inconclusive X-ray signals, except for a handful of individual cases. As the most natural explanation, high obscuration, is disfavored by JWST spectroscopic evidence, several authors have suggested that the X-ray weakness of LRDs is intrinsic, due to super-Eddington accretion rates. In this work, we test that scenario by stacking X-ray data for 55 LRDs in the Chandra Deep Field South, accumulating a total exposure time of nearly 400 Ms. Despite reaching unprecedented X-ray depths, our stack still yields a non-detection. The corresponding upper limits are deep enough to rule out current super-Eddington accretion models, and are compatible only with extremely high levels of obscuration ($N\_Hrsim10^{25}$\raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitildecm$^{-2}$). To explain the X-ray weakness of LRDs, we therefore speculate that the SMBHs in these systems are neither as massive nor as luminous as currently believed.}},

It is unclear whether the LRDs belong to an active galactic nucleus (AGN) or simply a collection of very compact star clusters. We build spectral energy distributions (SEDs) for 29 LRDs at $z \approx 3-8.5$ based on JWST photometric and spectroscopic observations. We find that the V-shaped SEDs of these LRDs exhibit a roughly similar break frequency at $ν\_{\rm b}=10^{14.96\pm0.06}$ Hz, which corresponds to $λ\_{\rm b}=3287\_{-424}^{+487} \textÅ$ in the rest frame. We propose that this unique SED can be explained by the combination of an inner standard disk and an outer gravitationally unstable accretion disk with Toomre parameter $Q\sim1$. The outer disk has a temperature of $\sim2000-4000$ K for typical AGN parameters, which can well reproduce the near- infrared to optical bump as observed in LRDs. This model can naturally explain the strong infrared to optical emission and the V-shaped SED with a similar break frequency $\simeq 10^{15}$ Hz for LRDs without invoking strong dust extinction or unusual stellar contribution from a host galaxy. Most LRDs stay in sub- Eddington state based on the SED modeling, which are intrinsically weak in X-rays.}},

As likely descendants of the red nugget population, cEGs offer a unique window into the early Universe, enabling the study of early galaxy evolution and the interplay between black holes, stellar bulges, and dark matter halos. Using data from Chandra and XMM-Newton, we investigate the properties of the hot gaseous halos in cEGs. Two galaxies - MRK 1216 and PGC 32873 - host luminous, spatially extended X-ray atmospheres, allowing us to derive radial thermodynamic profiles. For MRK 1216, we performed high-resolution spectral modeling with RGS data, which hints at super-solar $α/\rm{Fe}$ abundance ratios. The remaining galaxies show either faint or undetected X-ray halos, though several display AGN-like (active galactic nucleus) power-law emission. In the context of local scaling relations, cEGs show only mild deviations from the general galaxy population, exhibiting a slightly steeper $M\_{\star}-L\_{X}$ relation and occupying the lower boundary of the $M\_{\star}$-$M\_{\rm vir}$ relation. These trends suggest that high-redshift red nuggets may also host a diverse range of X-ray atmospheres.

The little red dots (LRDs), detected by several surveys at z > 4, present a significant interpretational challenge, as their spectral energy distributions (SEDs) can mimic both active galactic nucleus (AGN) and stellar population templates. This study analyzes 19 LRDs from the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey survey, utilizing NIRCam and MIRI photometry. By performing SED fitting across a vast parameter space, we explore a broad range of AGN fractions, defined as the ratio of the monochromatic luminosities (AGN, galaxy, and dust) over a specified wavelength range, 0.4{\textendash}0.7 {\ensuremath{\mu}}m rest frame. We find that 17 of the 19 LRDs investigated are consistent with having significant AGN contributions, with best-fitting AGN fractions ranging between 20\% and 70\%, while one galaxy shows a low AGN contribution (2\%) and another appears to be purely star forming. Moreover, assuming these LRDs do indeed host AGN, we can place limits on their black hole masses using the inferred AGN bolometric luminosities and adopting the Eddington limit. We find that, independent of the specific AGN fraction adopted, the LRDs' black holes are significantly overmassive relative to their host galaxies{\textemdash}by {\ensuremath{\sim}}1 dex, and up to {\ensuremath{\sim}}4 dex in the most extreme cases{\textemdash}compared to the local M$\_{{\textbullet}}${\textendash}M$\_{{\ensuremath{\star}}}$ relation.

Here, we present a comprehensive study of the variability of 314 LRDs with multi-epoch JWST observations in five deep fields: Ultra Deep Survey, GOODS-S, GOODS-N, A2744, and COSMOS. Our analyses use all publicly available JWST NIRCam imaging data in these fields, together with multi-epoch JWST MIRI images available. We measure the significance (signal-to- noise ratio or SNR$\_{var}$) of the variabilities for all LRDs and statistically evaluate their variabilities using the SNR$\_{var}$ distributions. We pay particular attention to the systematic offsets of photometric zero-points among different epochs that seem to commonly exist. The derived SNR$\_{var}$ distributions of the LRDs, including those with broad H{\ensuremath{\alpha}}/H{\ensuremath{\beta}} emission lines, follow the standard Gaussian distribution, and are generally consistent with those of the comparison samples of objects detected in the same images. This finding suggests that the LRD population, on average, does not show strong variability, which can be explained by super-Eddington accretion of the black holes in AGNs. Alternatively, many of them may be dominated by galaxies. We also find eight strongly variable LRD candidates with variability amplitudes of 0.24{\textendash}0.82 mag. The rest-frame optical spectral energy distributions of these variable LRDs should have a significant AGN contribution. Future JWST observations will provide more variability information on LRDs.}},

    abstract = {{By virtue of their red color, the dust in little red dots (LRDs) has been thought to be of appreciable influence, whether that dust is distributed in a torus around a compact active galactic nucleus (AGN) or diffuse in the interstellar medium (ISM) of nascent galaxies. In Casey et al. (2024) we predicted that, based on the compact sizes of LRDs (unresolved in JWST NIRCam imaging), detection of an appreciable dust mass would be unlikely. Here we present follow-up ALMA 1.3mm continuum observations of a sample of 60 LRDs drawn from Akins et al. (2024). None of the 60 LRDs are detected in imaging that reaches an average depth of $σ\_{rms}=22\,μJy$. A stack of the 60 LRDs also results in a non-detection, with an inverse-variance weighted flux density measurement of $S\_{1.3mm}=2.1\pm2.9\,μJy$. This observed limit translates to a 3$σ$ upper limit of 10$^6$ M$\_\odot$ in LRDs' dust mass, and $\lesssim10^{11}$ L$\_\odot$ in total dust luminosity; both are a factor of 10$\times$ deeper than previous submm stack limits for LRDs. These results are consistent with either the interpretation that LRDs are reddened due to compact but modest dust reservoirs (with $A\_{V}\sim2-4$) or, alternatively, that instead of being reddened by dust, they have extreme Balmer breaks generated by dense gas ($>10^{9}\,cm^{-3}$) enshrouding a central black hole.}},

The host galaxies are dense, with stellar half mass radii ($\rm 325\,pc \leq r\_{{\rm half},*} \leq 620\,pc$), and dust attenuation in the F444W band above 1.25. Their star formation has been recently quenched. They host relatively bright AGN that are dust-obscured and contribute significantly to the rest-frame optical red slope and have relatively low luminosity in the rest-frame ultraviolet, where the host galaxy's stars are more dominant. These LRDs are in an evolutionary phase of miniquenching that is the result of AGN feedback from their massive black holes. The LRDs in ASTRID are bright with F444W magnitudes of $23.5-25.5$. The less massive and fainter galaxies in ASTRID lack the dust concentration necessary to produce the red slope of an LRD, though this could be an effect of limited resolution. Most of the highest Eddington black holes are not LRDs due to their host galaxies having typical dust levels and relatively high star formation rates accompanying their highly accreting black holes, resulting in their spectra being too flat.}},

Among these BLAGNs, 15 are classified as Little Red Dots (LRDs) based on their rest-frame UV-optical spectral slopes and compact morphology. The number density of LRDs is $\sim 10^{-5}\,{\rm cMpc^{-3}}$, with a hint of declining towards the lower end of the probed redshift range. These BLAGNs and LRDs span broad H$α$ luminosities of $\sim 10^{42.2}-10^{43.7}\,{\rm erg\,s^{-1}}$, black hole masses of $\sim 10^{6.3}-10^{8.4}\,M\_\odot$, and Eddington ratios of $\sim 0.1-1$ (median value 0.4), though the black hole mass and Eddington ratio estimates carry large systematic uncertainties. Half of the LRDs show strong Balmer absorption, suggesting high- density gas surrounding the line-emitting region. We detect extended (hundreds of parsec) rest-frame UV-optical emission from the host galaxy in the majority of these LRDs, which contributes significantly or even dominantly to their total UV emission. This host emission largely accounts for the peculiar UV upturn of the LRD spectral energy distribution. We also measure the small-scale ($\lesssim 1\,{\rm cMpc}$) clustering of these BLAGNs and LRDs by cross-correlating with a photometric galaxy sample. Extrapolating the power-law two-point correlation function model to large linear scales, we infer a linear bias of $3.30\_{-2.04}^{+2.88}$ and typical halo masses of a few $\times 10^{11}\,h^{-1}M\_\odot$ for BLAGNs at the sample median redshift of $z\sim 4.5$. However, the inferred linear bias and halo masses of LRDs, while formally consistent with those for BLAGNs at $\sim 1.5σ$, appear too large to be compatible with their space density, suggesting LRDs may have strong excess clustering on small scales.}},

However, the dust-reddened AGN scenario is increasingly challenged by their faint near-to-far infrared emission and a potential ``dust budget crisis'' in cases when the host galaxy is either undetectably low-mass or absent. In this study, we re-evaluate the dust extinction level in LRDs by modeling the UV-to-infrared spectra for various extinction laws and a broad range of dusty distribution parameters. Comparing the predicted infrared fluxes with observational data from the JWST MIRI, Herschel, and ALMA, our analysis finds that the visual extinction is tightly constrained to $A\_V \lesssim 1.0$ mag for A2744-45924 and $A\_V \lesssim 1.5$ mag for RUBIES- BLAGN-1 under the SMC extinction laws, with slightly weaker constraints for those with gray extinction in the UV range. The revised $A\_V$ values yield a radiative efficiencies of $10\%$ for the LRD population, easing the tension with the Soltan argument for the bulk AGN population at lower redshifts. Moreover, this moderate extinction (or dust-free) scenario, with reprocessed emission spectra testable by future far-infrared observatories, provides a paradigm shift in understanding their natures, environments, and evolutionary pathways of massive black holes in the early universe.}},

These models apply an algorithm targeting direct solutions to the radiation transport equation in full general relativity and have been enabled by access to modern exascale computing systems. Super-Eddington accretion flows form geometrically thick radiation pressure supported disks that drive powerful equatorial outflows. A narrow funnel-shaped photosphere in the inner region results in very low radiative efficiencies in this regime. The structure of near- and sub- Eddington accretion depends on whether there is net vertical magnetic flux at the midplane of the disk. With net flux, the disk forms a thin, dense layer at the midplane surrounded by a magnetically-dominated corona, whereas without net flux the disk remains magnetically dominated everywhere. Although none of our models achieve the magnetically arrested disk (MAD) regime, those with net vertical flux and a rapidly spinning black hole still produce powerful relativistic jets. Our calculations adopt simple opacity models (with scalings appropriate to stellar-mass black hole accretion). We discuss the application of our results to observations of X-ray binaries and ultraluminous X-ray sources such as Cyg X-3 and SS433. We also speculate on the application of our super-Eddington models to the interpretation of little red dots (LRDs) recently discovered by JWST.}},

We present a theoretical model in which the LRDs descend from dark matter halos in the extreme low-spin tail of the angular momentum distribution. Within this framework, we explain their three key observational signatures: (i) abundance, (ii) compactness, and (iii) redshift distribution. Our model focuses on observed, not modeled, properties; it is thus independent of whether they are powered primarily by a black hole or stars. We find that the assumption that the prototypical LRD at $z \sim 5$ originates from halos in the lowest $\sim 1\%$ of the spin distribution is sufficient to reproduce both their observed number densities and physical sizes. The redshift evolution of their observability is driven by the interplay between the evolving compact disk fraction and cosmological surface brightness dimming. This effect leads to a well-defined ``LRDs Era'' at $4<z<8$, during which the LRDs are common and detectable; at $z<4$, they are bright but rare, while at $z>8$, they are common but faint. Finally, we test the predicted redshift trend against observational data, finding excellent agreement. Additional observational support comes from their excess small-scale clustering and spectral signatures of extreme core densities, both of which are expected outcomes of galaxy formation in low-spin halos. These findings suggest that the LRDs are not a fundamentally distinct population but the natural manifestation of galaxies forming in the rarest, lowest angular momentum environments.}},

Most of the LRDs with existing spectral observations exhibit broad Balmer lines and are thus likely to host active galactic nuclei (AGNs). Here we present a study of LRDs with no broad H-alpha component. Our sample consists of five LRDs at z\raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde5 with H-alpha line widths of about 250 km/s. They are selected from 32 LRDs that have NIRSpec high- or medium-resolution grating spectra covering H-alpha. During our construction of the sample, we find that approximately 20 percent of the LRD candidates previously selected do not show red continuum emission but resemble the V-shape spectra due to strong line emission. Compared to normal star-forming galaxies, narrow-line LRDs tend to have relatively higher H-alpha line widths and luminosities. If these LRDs are dominated by galaxies, our SED modeling suggests that they are dusty, compact star-forming galaxies with high stellar masses and star formation rates (SFRs). Alternatively, if their SEDs are produced by AGNs, the inferred central black hole masses (MBH) are in the range of 10\^5 to 10\^6 solar masses, placing them at the low-mass end of the AGN population. They may represent an early stage of super-Eddington growth, where the black holes have yet to accumulate significant masses. With large measurement uncertainties, these black holes appear slightly overmassive relative to the local MBH-Mstar relation, but consistent or undermassive with respect to the MBH-sigma and MBH-Mdyn relations. We further find that nearly half of the high-redshift broad-line AGNs exhibit V-shape SEDs. (abridged)}},

A critical question remains: if LRDs were common at high redshifts, how would they evolve into local elliptical galaxies with significantly lower central densities? To address this, we performed direct N-body simulations of LRD mergers, focusing on the coevolution of host galaxies and central SMBHs. We track the complete evolution of SMBH binaries into the three-body hardening and gravitational-wave (GW) emission phase. Our results demonstrate that during galaxy mergers, the central SMBHs can eject a substantial amount of mass from the galactic core via the three-body slingshot effect, leading to a decrease in central stellar surface density by an order of magnitude. Additionally, GW recoil can further contribute in making the galaxy centers less dense and more in alignment with low-redshift quiescent galaxies. This transformation occurs on a relatively short timescale of a few {\ensuremath{\sim}}100 Myr, implying that LRDs can evolve into lower-redshift elliptical galaxies by z < 4. The timescales for our SMBH mergers vary between 100 and 800 Myr, depending on the initial orbital parameters of the merging galaxies and the mass ratio of the SMBHs. Our findings provide a plausible mechanism for the transformation of LRDs into elliptical galaxies while highlighting the efficiency of SMBH mergers in such high-density environments, which plays a crucial role in SMBH growth.}},

Photometric samples are constructed from varying selection criteria with limited spectroscopic follow-up available to test intrinsic spectral shapes and prevalence of broad emission lines. We use the RUBIES survey, a large spectroscopic program with wide color-morphology coverage and homogeneous data quality, to systematically analyze the emission-line kinematics, spectral shapes, and morphologies of $\sim$1500 galaxies at $z > 3.1$. We identify broad Balmer lines via a novel fitting approach that simultaneously models NIRSpec/PRISM and G395M spectra, yielding 80 broad-line sources with 28 (35\%) at $z > 6$. A large subpopulation naturally emerges from the broad Balmer line sources, with 36 exhibiting `v-shaped' UV-to-optical continua and a dominant point source component in the rest-optical; we define these as spectroscopic LRDs, constituting the largest such sample to date. Strikingly, the spectroscopic LRD population is largely recovered when either a broad line or rest-optical point source is required in combination with a v-shaped continuum, suggesting an inherent link between these three defining characteristics. We compare the spectroscopic LRD sample to published photometric searches. Although these selections have high accuracy, down to $\rm F444W<26.5$, only 50-62\% of the RUBIES LRDs were previously identified. The remainder were missed due to a mixture of faint rest-UV photometry, comparatively blue rest-optical colors, or highly uncertain photometric redshifts. Our findings highlight that well-selected spectroscopic campaigns are essential for robust LRD identification, while photometric criteria require refinement to capture the full population.}},

For JADES, the NEP-TDF and CEERS, we compare SED models with and without AGN components and analyse the impact of an AGN component on the goodness of fit using the Bayesian information criterion (BIC). We find that whilst the $χ^{2}$ of the majority of models containing AGN components is improved compared to models without AGN components, we show that the BIC suggests models without AGN are a more appropriate fit to LRD SEDs, especially when MIRI data is available. We also measure LRD clustering in the CEERS field, JADES field, and NEP- TDF, where we compare the spatial distribution of LRDs and galaxies with Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests of equality of distribution. We find that the neighbourhood of LRDs tends to be less dense compared to galaxies at all selections and masses and at similar redshifts. We further measure upper limit estimates for the halo masses of LRDs using abundance matching. Whilst the population of LRDs could be a mixture of several different inherent populations, as a whole it does appear that these systems are mostly hosting compact galaxies or star clusters in formation.}},

We initially identify over 6000 sources with emission line width broader than typical emission line galaxies (ELGs) by analysing the 1D spectra. These 'broad' emission lines may originate from QSO's broad lines (<inline-formula><tex-math id=``TM0001'' notation=``LaTeX''>$\rm FWHM\ge 1200\textasciitilde \rm km\,s^{-1}$</tex-math></inline-formula>) or ELG's convolved narrow lines (<inline-formula><tex-math id=``TM0002'' notation=``LaTeX''>$\rm FWHM = 200\sim 300\,km\,s^{-1}$</tex-math></inline-formula>) with effective radii <inline-formula><tex-math id=``TM0003'' notation=``LaTeX''>$\ge$</tex-math></inline-formula>0.3 arcsec (2.5 Kpc at z = 1). We then propose a criterion based on the reliability of the QSO component in the forward modeling results. Using the known QSOs, ELGs, and simulation data, we find that our criterion successfully selects about 90 per cent of known QSOs with H <inline-formula><tex-math id=``TM0004'' notation=``LaTeX''>$\alpha$</tex-math></inline-formula> or H <inline-formula><tex-math id=``TM0005'' notation=``LaTeX''>$\beta$</tex-math></inline-formula> line detection and point-like structures, with an ELG contamination rate of about 5 per cent.

This sample covers a broader range of the rest-frame UV colours and has redder optical slopes compared to the SDSS QSOs, yet it is likely to be composed of normal QSOs rather than little red dots.

Unlike past use of color indices to identify LRDs, we employ continuum slope fitting using shifting bandpasses to sample the same rest-frame emission blueward and redward of the Balmer break. This enables the detection of LRDs over a wider redshift range and with less contamination from galaxies with strong breaks that otherwise lack a rising red continuum. The redshift distribution of our sample increases at z < 8 and then undergoes a rapid decline at z {\ensuremath{\sim}} 4.5, which may tie the emergence of these sources to the inside-out growth that galaxies experience during this epoch. We find that LRDs are {\ensuremath{\sim}}1 dex more numerous than X-ray- and UV- selected active galactic nuclei (AGN) at z {\ensuremath{\sim}} 5{\textendash}7.

    abstract = {{We report the discovery of a little red dot (LRD), dubbed BiRD ('big red dot'), at $z=2.33$ in the field around the $z=6.3$ quasar SDSSJ1030+0524. Using NIRCam images, we identified it as a bright outlier in the $F200W-F356W$ color vs $F356W$ magnitude diagram of point sources in the field. The NIRCam/WFSS spectrum reveals the emission from HeI$λ10830$ and PaG line, both showing a narrow and a broad ($FWHMrsim 2000\ \rm kms^{-1}$) component. The HeI line is affected by an absorption feature, tracing dense gas with HeI column density in the $2^3S$ level $N\sim 0.5-1.2\times 10^{14}\rm cm^{-2}$, depending on the location of the absorber, which is outflowing at the speed of $Δv \sim -830\ \rm kms^{-1}$. As observed in the majority of LRDs, BiRD does not show X-ray or radio emission. The BH mass and the bolometric luminosity, both inferred from the PaG broad component, amount to $M\_{\rm BH}\sim 10^8\rm M\_{\odot}$ and $L\_{\rm bol}\sim 2.9\times 10^{45}\rm ergs^{-1}$, respectively. Intriguingly, BiRD presents strict analogies with other two LRDs spectroscopically confirmed at cosmic noon, GN-28074 (``Rosetta Stone'') at $z=2.26$ and RUBIES-BLAGN-1 at $z=3.1$. The blueshifted HeI absorption detected in all three sources suggests that gas outflows may be common in LRDs. We derive a first estimate of the space density of LRDs at $z<3$ based on JWST data, as a function of $L\_{\rm bol}$ and BH mass. The space density is only a factor of $\sim 2-3$ lower than that of UV- selected quasars with comparable $L\_{\rm bol}$ and $z$, meaning that the contribution of LRDs to the broader AGN population is also relevant at cosmic noon. A similar trend is also observed in terms of BH masses. If, as suggested by recent theories, LRDs probe the very first and rapid growth of black hole seeds, our finding may suggest that the formation of black hole seeds remains efficient at least up to cosmic noon.}},

The target exhibits all the hallmark features of a 'Little Red Dot' (LRD) AGN. The combination of spatially resolved and high-resolution spectroscopy offers deeper insight into its nature. The H$α$ line has multiple components, including two broad Gaussians, yielding a black-hole mass of $\log(M\_{\rm BH}/M\_\odot) = 7.65$, while the narrow [O III]$λ$5007 gives a galaxy dynamical mass of $\log(M\_{\rm dyn}/M\_\odot) = 9.1$, suggesting a dynamically overmassive black hole relative to the host galaxy. The target has two satellites, and is immersed in a 7-kpc wide pool of ionized gas. A spatially detached outflow is also tentatively detected. H$α$ shows strong absorption with high equivalent width (EW), ruling out a stellar origin, and with velocity and velocity dispersion of v = -13 km s$^{-1}$ and $σ$ = 120 km s$^{-1}$. There is tentative evidence (2.6 $σ$) of temporal variability in the EW of the H$α$ absorber over two rest-frame months. If confirmed, this would suggest a highly dynamic environment. Notably, while the H$α$ absorber is clearly visible and even dominant in the high-resolution G395H observations, it is not detected in the medium-resolution G395M data of the same epoch. This implies that the current incidence rate of absorbers in LRDs - and especially of rest-frame absorbers - may be severely underestimated, because most LRDs rely on lower-resolution spectroscopy. In this context, the high incidence rate of rest-frame absorbers in LRDs may indicate a configuration that is either intrinsically stationary, such as a rotating disc, or that exhibits time-averaged stability, such as an oscillatory 'breathing mode' accretion of cyclic expansion and contraction of the gas around the SMBH.}},

    abstract = {{JWST observations have uncovered a new population of red, compact objects at high redshifts dubbed ``little red dots'' (LRDs), which typically show broad emission lines and are thought to be dusty active galactic nuclei (AGNs). Some of their other features, however, challenge the AGN explanation, such as prominent Balmer breaks and extremely faint or even missing metal high-ionization lines, X-ray, or radio emission, including in deep stacks. Time variability is another robust test of AGN activity. Here, we exploit the z = 7.045 multiply imaged LRD A2744-QSO1, which offers a particularly unique test of variability due to lensing-induced time delays between the three images spanning 22 yr (2.7 yr in the rest-frame), to investigate its photometric and spectroscopic variability. We find the equivalent widths (EWs) of the broad H{\ensuremath{\alpha}} and H{\ensuremath{\beta}} lines, which are independent of magnification and other systematics, to exhibit significant variations, of up to 18 {\ensuremath{\pm}} 3\% for H{\ensuremath{\alpha}} and up to 22 {\ensuremath{\pm}} 8\% in H{\ensuremath{\beta}}, on a timescale of 875 d (2.4 yr) in the rest-frame. This suggests that A2744-QSO1 is indeed an AGN. We find no significant photometric variability beyond the limiting systematic uncertainties, so it currently cannot be determined whether the EW variations are due to line-flux or continuum variability. These results are consistent with a typical damped random walk variability model for an AGN such as A2744-QSO1 (M$\_{BH}$ = 4 {\texttimes} {}10$^{7}$ M$\_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$) given the sparse sampling of the light curve with the available data. Our results therefore support the AGN interpretation of this LRD, and highlight the need for further photometric and spectroscopic monitoring in order to build a detailed and reliable light curve.}},

Many of these systems, now known as ``little red dots,'' are compact and have unique colors that are very red in the optical/near-infrared and blue in the ultraviolet. The relative contribution of galaxy starlight and AGN to these systems remains uncertain, especially for the galaxies with unusual blue+red spectral energy distributions. In this work, we use Balmer decrements to measure the independent dust attenuation of the broad and narrow emission-line components of a sample of 29 broad-line AGN identified from three public JWST spectroscopy surveys: CEERS, JADES, and RUBIES.

The narrow and broad Balmer decrements imply little to no attenuation of the narrow emission lines, which are consistent with being powered by star formation and located on larger physical scales. Meanwhile, the lower limit in the broad H{\ensuremath{\alpha}}/H{\ensuremath{\beta}} decrement, with broad H{\ensuremath{\beta}} undetected in the stacked spectrum of 25 broad H{\ensuremath{\alpha}} AGN, implies significant dust attenuation of the broad-line emitting region that is presumably associated with the central AGN.

We select these sources directly from JWST/NIRSpec G395M/F290LP spectra. We use a multistep pre-selection and Bayesian fitting to ensure a high- quality sample of sources with broad Balmer lines and narrow forbidden lines. We compute rest-frame ultraviolet and optical spectral slopes for these objects, and determine that 21 BLAGNs in our sample are also little red dots (LRDs). These LRD BLAGNs, when examined in aggregate, show broader H{\ensuremath{\alpha}} line profiles and a higher fraction of broad-to-narrow component H{\ensuremath{\alpha}} emission than non-LRD BLAGNs. We find that {\ensuremath{\sim}}90\% of LRD BLAGNs are intrinsically reddened ({\ensuremath{\beta}}$\_{opt}$ > 0), independent of contributions from emission lines to the broadband photometry. We construct the black hole (BH) mass function at 3.5 < z < 6 after computing robust completeness corrections. This BH mass function shows agreement with recent JWST-based BH mass functions, though we extend these earlier results to log (M$\_{BH}$/M$\_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$) < 7. The derived BH mass function is consistent with theoretical models, indicating that the observed abundance of BHs in the early Universe may not be discrepant with physically motivated predictions. The BH mass function shape resembles a largely featureless power law, suggesting that signatures from BH seeding have been lost by redshift z {\ensuremath{\sim}} 5{\textendash}6. Finally, we compute the BLAGN UV luminosity function and find agreement with JWST-detected BLAGN samples from recent works, finding that BLAGN hosts constitute {\ensuremath{\lesssim}}10\% of the total observed UV luminosity at all but the brightest luminosities.}},

In this scenario, a small fraction of a halo, approximately $1\%$ of its mass, collapses into a dense core, which could further evolve into a black hole. We demonstrate that this process can account for the origin of JWST little red dots (LRDs) observed at redshifts $z\sim4-11$, where black holes with masses of $10^7{\rm\,M\_\odot}$ can form within $500{\rm\,Myr}$ after the formation of host halos with masses of $10^{9}{\rm\,M\_\odot}$. Even if the initial collapse region triggering general-relativistic instability has a mass on the order of one solar mass, the resulting seed can grow into an intermediate-mass black hole via Eddington accretion of baryonic gas. Subsequently, it can continue to grow into a supermassive black hole through dark Bondi accretion of dark matter particles. In this scenario, the majority of the black hole's mass originates from dark matter accretion rather than baryonic matter, naturally explaining the overmassive feature of LRDs.}},

One intriguing proposal is that black holes (BHs) could be the astrophysical source of dark energy through a cosmological coupling mechanism, and strong evidence has been claimed via analyzing the growth of the black hole masses in the red-sequence elliptical galaxies at redshifts $\leq 2.5$. In this work, with a group of very high redshift AGNs detected by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) in the red-sequence elliptical galaxies, we show that the possibility of BHs being the astrophysical source of dark energy has been rejected at a confidence level exceeding 10$σ$. Moreover, it turns out that the Little Red Dots recently discovered by JWST, characterized by the low accretion rates, can naturally evolve into the red- sequence elliptical galaxies hosting the relatively low mass black holes at the redshifts of $\sim 0.7-2.5$, without the need of black hole cosmological coupling.}},

Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) as part of the VLA Frontier Fields program, whose goal is to explore the radio continuum emission from high-redshift galaxies that are magnified by foreground, massive galaxy clusters. With an rms noise of $\approx 1 μ$Jy beam$^{-1}$, at the phase center, and sub-arcsec angular resolution ($θ\_{1/2}=0.82$ arcsec), this is the deepest and most detailed radio image of Abell 2744 ever obtained. A total of 93 sources are detected with a peak signal-to-noise ratio $\geq5$, of which 46 have optical/near-infrared (IR) counterparts with available redshift, magnification ($μ$), and stellar mass (${M}\_*$) estimates. The radio sources are distributed over a redshift from 0.15 to 3.55, with a median redshift value of $z = 0.93$, and a median stellar mass of ${M}\_{*}= 2.3 \times 10^{10}\,\rm{M}\_{\odot}$. A comparison between the radio-based star formation rates (SFRs) and those derived from ultraviolet- to-near IR data reveals that the radio SFRs are, on average, an order of magnitude higher than the ultraviolet-to-near IR SFRs. We look for radio counterparts of the so-called ``Little Red Dots (LRDs)'' galaxies at $z\approx6$ in Abell 2744, but find no significant detections. After stacking, we derive a 3$σ$ upper limit to the 6GHz radio luminosity of LRDs of $4.1\times 10^{39}\,\rm erg\,s^{-1}$. Finally, we present a sample of 22 moderately/strongly lensed galaxies ($μrsim 2$) in the VLA Frontier Fields survey, which is adequate to zoom into star formation processes of main sequence galaxies at $z\approx 1-2$.}},

The spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of this LRD pair show evidence of a Balmer break, consistent with a recent ({\ensuremath{\sim}}100 Myr) quenching of star formation. In contrast, the satellites are compatible with a recent-onset ({\ensuremath{\sim}}100 Myr), ongoing burst of star formation. LRD1's SED is consistent with a dust-free active galactic nucleus (AGN) being the source of the UV excess in the galaxy. The optical continuum would be powered by the emission from an obscured post-starburst and the AGN at a subdominant level. LRD2's SED is more ambiguous, but it could also be indicative of a dust-free AGN. In this scenario, these LRDs would be massive (M$\_{{\ensuremath{\star}}}$ {\ensuremath{\sim}} {}10$^{10}$ M$\_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$) and dusty (A(V) > 1 mag) and the three satellites would be lower- mass objects (M$\_{{\ensuremath{\star}}}$ {\ensuremath{\sim}} 10$^{8 ‑ 9}$ M$\_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$) subject to low dust attenuations. The proximity of the two LRDs suggests that their interaction is responsible for their recent star formation histories, which can be interpreted as environmental bursting and quenching in the epoch of reionization.}},

    abstract = {{One of JWST's most remarkable discoveries is a population of compact red galaxies known as Little Red Dots (LRDs). Their existence raises many questions about their nature, origin, and evolution. These galaxies show a steep decline in number density-nearly two orders of magnitude-from $z=6$ to $z=3$. In this study, we explore their potential evolution by identifying candidate descendants in CEERS, assuming a single evolutionary path: the development of a blue star-forming outskirt around the red compact core. Our color-magnitude selection identifies galaxies as red as LRDs at $z<4$, surrounded by young, blue stellar outskirts. Morphological parameters were derived from single S{\'e}rsic profile fits; physical properties were obtained from SED fitting using a stellar-only model. These ``post-LRD'' candidates show LRD-like features with $M\_\ast \sim 10^{10} \ M\_\odot $, central densities ($ Σ\_\ast \sim 10^{11} \ M\_\odot \ \text{kpc}^{-2}$ ), compact sizes, and red rest-frame colors, but with an added extended component. Their number density at $z = 3 \pm 0.5$ ( $ \sim 10^{-4.15} \, \text{Mpc}^{-3} $) matches that of LRDs at $5 < z < 7$ , supporting a possible evolutionary link. We observe a redshift-dependent increase in outskirts mass fraction and galaxy size-from $\sim 250$ pc at $ z = 5 $ to $\sim 600$ pc at $ z = 3 $-suggesting global stellar growth. Meanwhile, the core remains red and compact, but the V-shape fades as the outskirts grow. These findings support an evolutionary scenario in which LRDs gradually acquire an extended stellar component over cosmic time by cold accretion. This may explain the apparent decline in their observed number density at lower redshift.}},

In this framework, dark matter halos undergo gravothermal core collapse due to large self-interaction cross sections, resulting in the rapid formation of massive black hole (BH) seeds with masses $rsim 10^{5} M\_\odot$ at redshifts $z rsim 5$. We develop a semi-analytic model that tracks the evolution of the dark matter halo population, the redshift of collapse $z\_{\rm coll}$, and the corresponding BH mass function. Black hole growth is modeled stochastically via a log-normal Eddington ratio distribution and a finite duty cycle. We find that the uSIDM scenario naturally reproduces key observed properties of LRDs, including their abundance, compactness, and characteristic BH masses, while offering a mechanism for early, obscured black hole formation that is difficult to achieve in standard CDM- based models. The predicted SMBH mass function at $z \sim 5$ shows excellent agreement with LRD observational data and SIDM merger-tree simulations, particularly at the high-mass end $(m\_{\rm BH} rsim 10^{7} M\_\odot)$. These results suggest that LRDs may serve as powerful observational tracers of exotic dark sector physics and that SMBH formation in the early universe could be significantly shaped by non-gravitational dark matter interactions.}},

    abstract = {{The physical origin of Little Red Dots (LRDs)--compact extragalactic sources with red rest-optical continua and broad Balmer lines-- remains elusive. The redness of LRDs is likely intrinsic, suggesting optically thick gas emitting at a characteristic effective temperature of $\sim5000{\rm\textasciitilde K}$. Meanwhile, many LRD spectra exhibit a Balmer break, often attributed to absorption by a dense gas shell surrounding an AGN. Using semi-analytical atmosphere models and radiation transport calculations, we show that a super-Eddington accretion system can give rise to a Balmer break and a red optical color simultaneously, without invoking external gas absorption for the break or dust reddening. The break originates from a discontinuity in opacity across the Balmer limit, similar to that of early-type stars, but the lower photosphere density of super-Eddington systems, $ρ<10^{-9}{\rm\textasciitilde g\textasciitilde cm^{-3}}$, implies a significant opacity contrast even at a cool photosphere temperature of $\sim5000{\rm\textasciitilde K}$. Furthermore, while accretion in the form of a standard thin disk requires fine tuning to match the optical color of LRDs, an alternative scenario of a geometrically thick, roughly spherical accretion flow implies an effective temperature $4000{\rm\textasciitilde K}\lesssim T\_{\rm eff}\lesssim6000{\rm\textasciitilde K}$ that is very insensitive to the accretion rate (analogous to the Hayashi line in stellar models). The continuum spectra from the latter scenario align with the Balmer break and optical color of currently known LRDs. We discuss predictions of our model and the prospects for more realistic spectra based on super- Eddington accretion simulations.}},

The supermassive black holes (SMBHs) of $10^{5-8}{\rm\,M}\_{\odot}$ in LRDs favor a heavy-seed origin. We propose a mechanism for their formation: Clusters of primordial black holes, formed through long-short mode coupling on small scales in the early Universe, undergo sequential mergers over extended timescales. This mechanism can evade cosmic microwave background distortions and result in heavy-seed SMBHs via runaway mergers. We employ Monte Carlo simulations to solve the Smoluchowski coagulation equation and determine the runaway merging timescale. The resulting stochastic gravitational wave background offers a distinct signature of this process, and the forming SMBHs can be highly spinning at their formation due to the spin residual of the cluster from tidal fields. This mechanism may explain the rapidly spinning SMBHs in LRDs under the assumption of obscured active galactic nuclei.}},

This model suggests that the observed broad lines may be intrinsically narrower than observed, which would lead to black hole masses that are up to two orders of magnitude smaller than what inferred when assuming that the whole broad line comes from the BLR. To test this model, we present a joint analysis of multiple hydrogen recombination lines in the ``Rosetta Stone''AGN, the brightest known LRD at $z$=2.26. We show that H$α$, H$β$ and Pa$β$ have different spectral profiles, which is inconsistent with the predictions of the simple electron scattering scenario. Additionally, we test a variety of exponential models and show that none of them can simultaneously reproduce all three line profiles with physically plausible parameters. The inadequacy of these models for the Rosetta Stone implies that the scenario of electron scattering by an ionized medium surrounding the BLR is not universally applicable to LRDs and AGN, and therefore provides a counterexample to the claim of a universal and systematic overestimation of black hole masses.}},

Quasi-stars are hypothetical objects predicted to form following the core collapse of supermassive stars, and consist of black holes accreting from massive envelopes at a super-Eddington rate. We show that models of late-stage quasi- stars, with black hole masses exceeding $\sim 10\%$ of the total, predict thermal and radiative properties that are insensitive to both black hole and envelope mass, and spectrally resemble LRDs. Specifically, we show that they are likely to exhibit reddish colors, a strong Balmer break, and possess conditions favorable to the production of Balmer lines that are broadened by electron scattering. Their huge electron column densities suppress any X-rays. Late-stage quasi-stars, with black hole masses $rsim 10^6 M\_\odot$, should dominate the overall quasi-star population. Their short predicted lifetimes (tens of Myr), coupled with the high observed comoving density of LRDs, suggest that most or all supermassive black holes go through a quasi-star/LRD phase during their formation and growth.}},

We report the discovery of three local LRDs at $z = 0.1-0.2$, initially selected from the SDSS database, with follow-up optical/near-IR spectroscopy and photometry. They exhibit properties fully consistent with those of high-redshift LRDs, including broad hydrogen and helium emission lines, compact morphologies, V-shaped UV-optical SED, declining near-IR continua, and no significant variability. Two sources were targeted but not detected in X-rays with statistical significance. All three sources show blue-shifted He I absorption, while two exhibit H$α$ and Na D absorption lines. We detect full Balmer and Paschen line series in all three objects, along with abundant narrow [Fe II] emission in two. The emission line analyses suggest narrow lines originate from AGN-powered metal-poor regions with minimal dust; broad lines come from inner regions with exceptionally high density or atypical dust properties; and [Fe II] emission arises from dense gas between broad and narrow-line regions. One of our objects, J1025+1402 (nicknamed ``The Egg''), shows extremely high equivalent width Na D, K I, Fe II, and Ca II triplet absorption lines, suggesting the presence of a cool ($\sim$5000 K), metal-enriched gas envelope. The optical/near-IR continua of these LRDs are also consistent with theoretical models featuring an atmosphere around black holes. The WISE-detected IR emission is consistent with weak dust emission of $T \sim 10^2-10^3$ K. We propose a conceptual model consisting of a largely thermalized cool-gas envelope surrounding the central black hole and an extended emission line region with high-density outflowing gas to explain the observed properties of these local LRDs.}},

Concurrently, the rapid assembly of the first supermassive black holes (SMBHs) requires the formation of heavy seeds, for which supermassive stars (SMSs) are leading theoretical progenitors. In this work, we perform the first quantitative test of the hypothesis that LRDs are the direct observational manifestation of these primordial SMSs. We present a novel, first-principles pipeline generating synthetic spectra for a non-rotating, metal-free $10^6 \, M\_\odot$ SMS. We establish that its luminosity ($L\_λ\approx 1.7 \times 10^{44} \, \text{erg} \, \text{s}^{-1} \, μ\text{m}^{-1}$ at 4050 Angstroms) provides a decisive constraint, matching prominent LRDs. Our model self-consistently reproduces their defining spectral features: the extreme, V-shaped Balmer break is an intrinsic photospheric effect, while the complex line phenomenology, strong H$β$ in emission with other Balmer lines in absorption arises from non-LTE effects in a single stellar atmosphere. Applying physically motivated broadening, our spectrum provides an excellent quantitative match to LRDs at both high ($z=7.76$) and low ($z=3.55$) redshift. Our model provides a simple, self-consistent physical picture for LRDs, offering a compelling alternative to multi-component obscured AGN scenarios and suggesting we may be directly witnessing the final, luminous moments of an SMBH progenitor before its ultimate collapse.}},

However, the link between these objects and classical unobscured quasars remains a mystery. Here we report the discovery of obscured quasars hosted by the most luminous galaxies at z > 6, possibly bridging the gap between the two AGN populations. The 13 objects presented here were originally selected from a rest-frame ultraviolet (UV) imaging survey over >1000 deg$^{2}$, and were known to have luminous (>{}10$^{43}$ erg s$^{‑1}$) Ly{\ensuremath{\alpha}} emission. With JWST/NIRSpec follow-up observations, we found that 7 out of 11 objects with narrow Ly{\ensuremath{\alpha}} exhibit a broad component in H I Balmer lines and He I lines, but not in [O III] and other forbidden lines. Mild dust obscuration (0 < A$\_{V}$ < 3) is inferred from the Balmer decrements. The estimated intrinsic luminosities suggest that our broad-line (BL) objects are the long-sought UV-obscured counterparts of luminous quasars in the EoR. They host supermassive black holes (SMBHs) with masses 10$^{7.8‑9.1}$M$\_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$, undergoing sub- Eddington to Eddington accretion. Most of the BL objects are spatially unresolved and are close to ``little red dots'' with their blue rest-UV and red rest-optical colors. We estimate the AGN number density among similarly luminous Ly{\ensuremath{\alpha}} emitters to be larger than 2 {\texttimes} 10$^{‑8}$ Mpc$^{‑3}$. This density is comparable to that of classical quasars with similar continuum luminosities, suggesting that a substantial fraction of active SMBHs are obscured in the EoR and have been overlooked in past rest-UV surveys.}},

One of the remarkable findings is the identification of ``little red dots'' (LRDs), a unique class of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) with distinct characteristics representing a key phase in the formation and growth of early BHs. Here, we analyze the occurrence rate of LRDs, which emerge around redshifts z {\ensuremath{\sim}} 6{\textendash}8 and sharply decline at z < 4. We find that this trend follows a log-normal distribution, commonly observed in phenomena driven by stochastic and random factors. We propose a hypothesis that the first one or two AGN events associated with newly formed seed BHs are observed as LRDs, and their unique features fade in the subsequent episodes. This naturally explains the cosmic evolution of AGN abundance over 0 < z < 5, which follows {\ensuremath{\propto}}(1 + z)$^{‑5/2}$ due to the cumulative effect of recurring AGN activity. The unique characteristics of LRDs are likely linked to the dense gas environments around the seed BHs, which create strong absorption features in the broad-line emission and enable super-Eddington accretion bursts, ultimately yielding the observed overmassive nature of BHs compared to the local relationship. An analytical expression for the redshift evolution of LRD abundance is provided for direct comparison with future observational constraints.}},

One proposed channel are rapidly accreting supermassive PopIII stars (SMSs) that form in large primordial gas halos and grow up to $<10^6\,M\_\odot$. They eventually collapse due to the general relativistic instability and could lead to supernova-like explosions. This releases massive and energetic ejecta that then interact with the halo medium via an optically thick shock. We develop a semi-analytic model to compute the shock properties, bolometric luminosity, emission spectrum and photometry over time. The initial data is informed by stellar evolution and general relativistic SMS collapse simulations. We find that SMS explosion light curves reach a brightness $\sim10^{45\mathrm{-}47}\,\mathrm{erg/s}$ and last $10$-$200$ years in the source frame - up to $250$-$3000$ years with cosmic time dilation. This makes them quasi-persistent sources which vary indistinguishably to little red dots and AGN within $0.5$-$9\,(1+z)$ yrs. Bright SMS explosions are observable in long-wavelength JWST filters up to $z\leq20$ ($24$-$26$ mag) and pulsating SMSs up to $z\leq15$. EUCLID and the Roman space telescope (RST) can detect SMS explosions at $z<11$-$12$. Their deep fields could constrain the SMS rate down to $10^{-11}$Mpc$^{-3}$yr$^{-1}$, which is much deeper than JWST bounds. Based on cosmological simulations and observed star formation rates, we expect to image up to several hundred SMS explosions with EUCLID and dozens with RST deep fields.}},

If they exist, an abundant population of compact objects known as cosmic string loops permeate the Universe at all times, providing a secondary source of density perturbations that are large amplitude and non-gaussian in nature. In general, these loops are not stationary in the rest frame of the dark matter, thus their relative velocities will typically seed both spherical and filamentary overdensities in the matter era. Building upon previous work, we provide an improved framework to compute the complete halo mass function for these string seeded overdensities, valid for any loop velocity distribution. Using this mass function, we also compute the subset of halos capable of undergoing a direct collapse, forming a population of black holes with initial mass $10^{4-5} \, M\_{\odot}$ at high redshifts.

    abstract = {{Little Red Dots (LRDs) are compact, red sources discovered by JWST at high redshift ($z rsim 4$), marked by distinctive ``V-shaped'' spectral energy distributions (SEDs) and often interpreted as rapidly accreting AGNs. Their evolution remains unclear, as identifying counterparts at lower redshifts is challenging. We present WISEA J123635.56+621424.2 (here dubbed \{\textbackslashit the Saguaro\}), a $z=2.0145$ galaxy in GOODS- North, as a possible analog of high-redshift LRDs and a potential missing link in their evolutionary path toward lower- redshift systems. It features a compact LRD-like nucleus surrounded by a face-on spiral host. Its connection to LRDs includes that: (1) its nuclear spectrum shows a clear ``V-shaped'' SED; and (2) when redshifted to $z=7$, surface brightness dimming makes the host undetectable, thus mimicking an LRD. This suggests that high-redshift LRDs may be embedded in extended hosts. To test this, we stack rest-frame UV images of 99 photometrically selected LRDs, revealing faint, diffuse emission. Stacking in redshift bins reveals mild radial growth, consistent with the expected galaxy size evolution. A simple analytic model confirms that surface brightness dimming alone can explain their compact appearance. Lastly, we show that \{\textbackslashit the Saguaro\} is not unique by describing similar objects from the literature at $z\lesssim3.5$. Taken together, our results support a scenario in which LRDs may not be a distinct population, but could be the visible nuclei of galaxies undergoing a short-lived, AGN-dominated evolutionary phase, with their compact, red appearance driven largely by observational biases.}},

    abstract = {{Green Pea galaxies are a class of compact, low-mass, low-metallicity star-forming galaxies in the relatively local Universe. They are believed to be analogs of high-redshift galaxies that reionized the Universe, and, indeed, the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is now uncovering such populations at record redshifts. Intriguingly, JWST finds evidence suggestive of active galactic nuclei (AGN) in many of these distant galaxies, including the elusive Little Red Dots, which broadly lack any detectable X-ray counterparts. Intuitively, one would expect to detect an AGN in their low-redshift analogs with X-rays, yet no study to date has conclusively identified an X-ray AGN within a Green Pea galaxy. Here we present the deepest X-ray campaign of a Green Pea galaxy performed to date, obtained with the goal of discerning the presence of a (potentially low-luminosity) AGN. The target{\textemdash}SDSS J082247.66+224144.0 (hereafter J0822+2241){\textemdash}was previously found to display a comparable X-ray spectral shape to more local AGN ({\ensuremath{\Gamma}} {\ensuremath{\sim}} 2) and a high luminosity (L$\_{2‑10 keV}$ {\ensuremath{\sim}} {}10$^{42}$ erg s$^{‑1}$). We show that over 6.2 yr (rest frame) the 2{\textendash}10 keV luminosity of J0822+2241 is constant, whereas the soft 0.5{\textendash}2 keV flux has decreased significantly by {\ensuremath{\sim}}60\%. We discuss possible scenarios to explain the X-ray properties of J0822+2241, finding transient low column density obscuration surrounding an AGN to be the only plausible scenario. J0822+2241 thus provides further evidence that low-luminosity AGN activity could have contributed to the epoch of reionization and that local analogs are useful to derive a complete multiwavelength picture of black hole growth in high-redshift, low-luminosity AGNs. *Based on observations obtained with XMM-Newton, an ESA science mission with instruments and contributions directly funded by ESA Member States and NASA.}},

    abstract = {{Early JWST studies reporting an unexpected abundance of massive galaxies at z {\ensuremath{\sim}} 5{\textendash}8 challenge galaxy formation models in the {\ensuremath{\Lambda}}CDM framework. Previous stellar mass (M$\_{{\ensuremath{\star}}}$) estimates suffered from large uncertainties due to the lack of rest-frame near-infrared data. Using deep JWST/NIRCam and Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) photometry from Public Release IMaging for Extragalactic Research, we systematically analyze massive galaxies at z {\ensuremath{\sim}} 3{\textendash}8, leveraging rest-frame {\ensuremath{\gtrsim}}1 {\ensuremath{\mu}}m constraints. We find MIRI is critical for robust M$\_{{\ensuremath{\star}}}$ measurements for massive galaxies at z > 5: excluding MIRI overestimates M$\_{{\ensuremath{\star}}}$ by {\ensuremath{\sim}}0.4 dex on average for M$\_{{\ensuremath{\star}}}$ > {}10$^{10}$M$\_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$ galaxies, with no significant effects at lower masses. This reduces number densities of M$\_{{\ensuremath{\star}}}$ > {}10$^{10}$M$\_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$ (10$^{10.3}$M$\_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$) galaxies by {\ensuremath{\sim}}36\% (55\%). MIRI inclusion also reduces ``Little Red Dot'' (LRD) contamination in massive galaxy samples, lowering the LRD fraction from {\ensuremath{\sim}}32\% to {\ensuremath{\sim}}13\% at M$\_{{\ensuremath{\star}}}$ > 10$^{10.3}$M$\_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$. Assuming pure stellar origins, LRDs exhibit M$\_{{\ensuremath{\star}}}$ {\ensuremath{\sim}} 10$^{9{\textendash}10.5}$M$\_{{\ensuremath{\odot}} }$with MIRI constraints, rarely exceeding 10$^{10.5}$M$\_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$. Within standard {\ensuremath{\Lambda}}CDM, our results indicate a moderate increase in the baryon-to-star conversion efficiency (ϵ) toward higher redshifts and masses at z > 3. For the most massive z {\ensuremath{\sim}} 8 galaxies, ϵ {\ensuremath{\sim}} 0.3, compared to ϵ {\ensuremath{\lesssim}} 0.2 for typical galaxies at z < 3. This result is consistent with models where high gas densities and short free-fall times suppress stellar feedback in massive high-z halos.}},

    abstract = {{We present a spectroscopic analysis of a broad-line active galactic nucleus (AGN) selected as little red dot at $z = 5.3$ behind the Bullet cluster (Bz5.3), based on JWST/NIRCam and NIRSpec data. The detection of strong FeII, OI, and CaII triplet emission lines, along with the evidence of broad Balmer lines, provides unambiguous evidence of a broad-line region (BLR) and an accreting supermassive black hole. Notably, we report the first detection of the $\lambda1304$ bump (i.e., blend of OI$λ$1304 and SiII) at high redshift, a feature commonly seen in local AGNs but not yet reported in the early Universe. The OI$λ$1304/$\lambda8446$ photon ratio is highly suppressed (0.1-0.3), implying significant internal dust extinction, with estimated dust attenuation $A\_V \sim 0.4$-$1.0$. We identify Ly$β$ fluorescence as the dominant excitation mechanism of the low-ionization lines, with additional contributions from collisional excitation. High OI$λ$8446 equivalent width and weak OI$λ$7774 support this interpretation. The detection of iron emission, whether from broad permitted or narrow forbidden lines, supports the presence of a stratified BLR, as also recently proposed in local LRDs. Photoionization modeling of OI$λ$8446 and CaII further suggests the coexistence of multiple gas phases with distinct densities and ionization states, highlighting the complexity of the BLR. Bz5.3 thus offers a rare window into early AGN activity and BLR physics at early times.}},

    abstract = {{We propose an alternative physical interpretation and formation pathway for the recently discovered ``little red dots'' (LRDs). We model LRDs as super-massive stars (SMSs) surrounded by massive self- gravitating accretion discs (SMDs) that form as a consequence of gas-rich major galaxy mergers. The model provides an excellent match for numerous spectral features of LRDs, where the V-shape arises from the superposition of two black bodies, and Balmer line broadening is sourced by the intrinsic rotation of the SMD. No additional AGN, stellar wind, dust obscuration or galactic component is required. This results in a model with uniquely few, physically motivated free parameters that are robust to variations in observed LRD properties. We perform MCMC fits for two representative LRD spectra, for which the full parameter posterior distributions are determined. Allowing for a compressed SMS mass-radius relation, the recovered parameters are compatible with sub-Eddington accretion in self-gravitating discs, and the recovered SMS masses of few $ 10^6$ M$\_{\odot}$ imply the subsequent formation of massive black holes (BH) that squarely follow the expected BH mass--galaxy mass relation. In addition, the model implies a redshift distribution for LRDs that accurately matches with observations.}},
