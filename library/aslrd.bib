This survey demonstrates mid-IR selection as an efficient method to find luminous type 2 QSOs and the composite photometry generated by this sample provides a guide for finding more type 2 QSOs at higher redshift in the future.}},

These AGNs are identified by their broad H$α$ or H$β$ emission lines through the NIRCam grism wide-field slitless spectroscopy. One object at $z = 7.646$ with broad H$β$ emission has an F444W magnitude of 23.6 mag, making it one of the brightest $z > 7.5$ broad-line AGNs yet known. Among the 13 AGNs, 10 objects have reddened optical continua with slopes $β\\\\\\_{\rm opt}>0$. The remaining three objects have their overall SEDs that resemble those of UV-luminous quasars at similar redshifts, but their $β\\\\\\_{\rm opt}$, though negative, are not as blue as those of unobscured quasars. We also obtain MIRI photometry at 7.7-18 $μ$m for two AGNs and place strong constraints on their rest- frame near-IR SED. We find no significant variability in the rest-frame UV by comparing the COSMOS-3D and COSMOS-Web F115W images taken apart by 60 days in the rest-frame. We compute the H$α$ luminosity functions (LFs) for the broad H$α$ emitters at $z \approx 5-6$ and find a potential redshift evolution when compared with that of the $z \approx 4-5$ sample. We also derive the H$β$ LF at $z\sim8$ for AGNs and galaxies by combining our sample with those from the literature. The broad H$β$ emitters in this work suggest a number density two orders of magnitude higher than that predicted by the quasar LF based on rest-frame UV-selected samples. As a preview, our work showcases the ability of the COSMOS-3D grism survey to provide a complete view of the properties, growth, and evolution of bright broad-line AGNs at $z>5$.}},

    abstract = {{Galaxies grow alongside their central supermassive black holes (SMBHs), linked through fueling and feedback.

Using a suite of semi-analytic models (SAMs), we trace SMBH mass assembly across $M\\\\\\_{\rm BH} \sim 10^{6-10}, \mathrm{M}\\\\\\_{\odot}$. We find significant discrepancies between observations and physics-based models of the local black hole mass function (BHMF), likely due to differences in the underlying stellar mass function and the scaling relations therefrom used to infer the BHMF. However, most physics-based models agree at $z \sim 1-4$ and align reasonably well with broad-line AGN BHMF from JWST observations at $z=4-5$. Most physics-based models reproduce the bolometric AGN luminosity evolution, except \{\textbackslashsc Dark Sage\}, which predicts an excess deviating from models and observations. Interestingly, this pronounced ``knee' in the bolometric AGN luminosity function predicted by \{\textbackslashsc Dark Sage\} around $L\\\\\\_{\rm bol} \sim 10^{46} \, \mathrm{erg \, s^{-1}}$ is consistent with the inferred luminosity of ``Little Red Dots'' at $z=5-6$, assuming that their entire emission originates from AGN activity. We analyze black hole mass build-up and accretion histories in \{\textbackslashsc Dark Sage\}, which, unlike other models, allows for super-Eddington accretion. We report that on average, SMBHs in \{\textbackslashsc Dark Sage\} primarily grow through secular disk instabilities and merger-driven cold gas accretion, while black hole mergers contribute 60\textbackslash\\\\\\\% of the total mass budget only for the most massive SMBHs by $z=0$.}},

    abstract = {{The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has uncovered a new population of candidate broad-line AGN emerging in the early Universe, named ``little red dots'' (LRDs) because of their compactness and red colors at optical wavelengths. LRDs appear to be surprisingly abundant ({\ensuremath{\approx}}10$^{-5}$ cMpc$^{-3}$) given that their inferred bolometric luminosities largely overlap with those of the UV-luminous quasars identified at high z in wide- field spectroscopic surveys. In this work, we investigate how the population of LRDs and/or other UV-obscured AGN relates to the one of unobscured, UV-selected quasars. By comparing their number densities, we infer an extremely large and rapidly evolving obscured:unobscured ratio, ranging from {\ensuremath{\approx}}20 : 1 at z {\ensuremath{\approx}} 4 to {\ensuremath{\approx}}2300 : 1 at z {\ensuremath{\approx}} 7, and possibly extending out to very high ({\ensuremath{\approx}}{}10$^{47}$ erg s$^{-1}$) bolometric luminosities. This large obscured:unobscured ratio is incompatible with the UV-luminous duty cycle measured for unobscured quasars at z {\ensuremath{\approx}} 4 - 6, suggesting that LRDs are too abundant to be hosted by the same halos as unobscured quasars. This implies that either (a) the bolometric luminosities of LRDs are strongly overestimated or (b) LRDs follow different scaling relations than those of UV-selected quasars, representing a new population of accreting SMBHs emerging in the early Universe. A direct comparison between the clustering of LRDs and that of faint UV-selected quasars will ultimately confirm these findings, and shed light on key properties of LRDs such as their host mass distribution and duty cycle. We provide a mock analysis for the clustering of LRDs and show that it is feasible with current and upcoming JWST surveys.}},

However, their number density is uncertain at $z<4$ due to the small sky coverage and limited blue wavelength coverage of JWST. We present our ground-based search for LRDs at $2\lesssim z\lesssim4$, combining ultra-deep Hyper Suprime-Cam photometry and various (near-)infrared surveys within a total area of $\sim3.1\,\mathrm{deg^{2}}$. We find that for LRDs with $M\\\\\\_{5500}<-22.5$, their number density declines from $\sim10^{-4.5}\,\mathrm{cMpc^{-3}}$ at $z>4$ to $\sim10^{-5.3}\,\mathrm{cMpc^{-3}}$ at $2.7<z<3.7$ and $\sim10^{-5.7}\,\mathrm{cMpc^{-3}}$ at $1.7<z<2.7$. We also present the Magellan/FIRE spectrum of our first followed-up candidate, DEEP23-z2LRD1 at $z\\\\\\_\mathrm{spec}=2.26$, as a proof of concept for our sample selection. Similar to high-redshift LRDs, the spectrum of DEEP23-z2LRD1 exhibits broad H$α$ emission with $\mathrm{FWHM}\approx2400\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$ and with nearly symmetric narrow H$α$ absorption. Additionally, DEEP23-z2LRD1 has extremely narrow [OIII] lines with $\mathrm{FWHM}\approx140\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$, suggesting the presence of an accreting black hole in a low-mass host galaxy. Limited by the angular resolution of ground-based surveys, we emphasize that spectroscopic follow-ups are required to characterize the contamination fraction of this sample and pin down LRD number density at $z<4$.}},

Leveraging new JWST/MIRI imaging from the MIDIS and PAHSPECS programs, we confirm Virgil's extraordinary nature among galaxies in JADES/GOODS-South, exhibiting a strikingly red NIRCam-to-MIRI color (F444W $-$ F1500W = $2.84\pm0.04$ mag). Deep NIRSpec/PRISM spectroscopy from the OASIS program offers key insights into the host galaxy, revealing properties of an average star-forming galaxy during Cosmic Reionization, such as a subsolar metallicity, low-to-moderate dust content, and a relatively high ionization parameter and electron temperature. By estimating the star formation rate of Virgil from UV and H$α$, we find evidence that the galaxy is either entering or fading out of a bursty episode. Although line-ratio diagnostics employed at high-$z$ would classify Virgil as an Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN), this classification becomes ambiguous once redshift evolution is considered. Nonetheless, Virgil occupies the same parameter space as recently confirmed AGNs at similar redshifts. The new deep MIRI data at 15 $μ$m reinforce the AGN nature of Virgil, as inferred from multiple spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting codes. Virgil's rising infrared SED and UV excess resemble those of Dust-Obscured Galaxies (DOGs) studied with Spitzer at Cosmic Noon, particularly blue-excess HotDOGs. Our results highlight the need for a multi-wavelength approach incorporating MIRI to uncover such extreme sources at $zrsim6$ and to shed light on the interplay between galaxy evolution and early black hole growth during Cosmic Reionization.}},

The [CI] line is narrow (FWHM $\sim 80$ km s$^{-1}$), implying a dynamical mass $\lesssim 10^{10}$ M$\\\\\\_\odot$, adopting conservative limits for the galaxy size. The dynamical mass limit is significantly lower than expected from the local $M\\\\\\_{\rm BH}$-$M\\\\\\_{\rm dyn}$ relation, and is an order of magnitude below the stellar mass derived from SED fitting, potentially supporting a non-stellar origin of the Balmer break. These results, while tentative, paint a picture of LRDs that is markedly different than typical high-$z$ quasars, which live in massive, gas-rich, and actively star-forming host galaxies.}},

The F356W grism data reveal 124 [O III]+H{\ensuremath{\beta}} emitters at 5.3 < z < 7, 53 of which constitute a protocluster spanning (10 cMpc)$^{2}$ across 6.5 < z < 6.8.

We fit the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of the [O III] emitters with Prospector and Bagpipes and find that none of the SED-derived properties (stellar mass, age, or star formation rate) correlate with proximity to the quasar. While there is no correlation between galaxy age and local galaxy density, we find modest correlations of local galaxy density with increasing stellar mass, decreasing 10{\textendash}100 Myr star formation rate ratios, and decreasing nebular line equivalent widths. We further find that the protocluster galaxies are consistent with being more massive, being older, and hosting higher star formation rates than the field sample at the 3{\ensuremath{\sigma}} level, distributed in a filamentary structure that supports inside-out formation of the protocluster. There is modest evidence that galaxy evolution proceeds differently as a function of the density of local environment within protoclusters during the epoch of reionization, and the central quasar has little effect on the galaxy properties of the surrounding structure.}},

    abstract = {{Recent James Webb Space Telescope observations have revealed a peculiar class of galaxies at redshifts $z rsim 6$, characterized by extremely high central stellar densities and overmassive central supermassive black holes (SMBHs), ``little red dots'' (LRDs). A critical question remains: If LRDs were common at high redshifts, how would they evolve into local elliptical galaxies with significantly lower central densities? To address this, we performed direct $N$-body simulations of LRD mergers, focusing on the coevolution of host galaxies and central SMBHs. We track the complete evolution of SMBH binaries into the three-body hardening and gravitational-wave (GW) emission phase. Our results demonstrate that during galaxy mergers, the central SMBHs can eject a substantial amount of mass from the galactic core via the three-body slingshot effect, leading to a decrease in central stellar surface density by an order of magnitude. Additionally, GW recoil can further contribute in making the galaxy centers less dense and more in alignment with low- redshift quiescent galaxies. This transformation occurs on a relatively short timescale of a few $\sim$100 Myr, implying that LRDs can evolve into lower-redshift elliptical galaxies by $z<4$. The timescales for our SMBH mergers vary between 100 Myr and 800 Myr, depending on the initial orbital parameters of the merging galaxies and the mass ratio of the SMBHs. Our findings provide a plausible mechanism for the transformation of LRDs into elliptical galaxies while highlighting the efficiency of SMBH mergers in such high-density environments, which plays a crucial role in SMBH growth.}},

One of the remarkable findings is the identification of ``Little Red Dots'' (LRDs), a unique class of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) with distinct characteristics representing a key phase in the formation and growth of early BHs. Here, we analyze the occurrence rate of LRDs, which emerge around redshifts $z \sim 6-8$ and sharply decline at $z < 4$. We find that this trend follows a log-normal distribution, commonly observed in phenomena driven by stochastic and random factors. We propose a hypothesis that the first one or two AGN events associated with newly-formed seed BHs are observed as LRDs and their unique features fade in the subsequent episodes. This naturally explains the cosmic evolution of AGN abundance over $0 < z < 5$, which follows $\propto (1+z)^{-5/2}$ due to the cumulative effect of recurring AGN activity. The unique characteristics of LRDs are likely linked to the dense gas environments around the seed BHs, which create strong absorption features in the broad-line emission and enable super-Eddington accretion bursts, ultimately yielding the observed overmassive nature of BHs compared to the local relationship.}},

    abstract = {{Recent James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) observations have revealed a population of sources with a compact morphology and a `v-shaped' continuum, namely blue at rest-frame $\lambda<4000$A and red at longer wavelengths. The nature of these sources, called `little red dots' (LRDs), is still debated, since it is unclear if they host active galactic nuclei (AGN) and their number seems to drastically drop at z<4. We utilise the 63 $deg^2$ covered by the quick Euclid Quick Data Release (Q1) to extend the search for LRDs to brighter magnitudes and to lower z than what has been possible with JWST to have a broader view of the evolution of this peculiar galaxy population. The selection is done by fitting the available photometric data (Euclid, Spitzer/IRAC, and ground-based griz data) with two power laws, to retrieve the rest-frame optical and UV slopes consistently over a large redshift range (i.e, z<7.6). We exclude extended objects and possible line emitters, and perform a visual inspection to remove imaging artefacts. The final selection includes 3341 LRD candidates from z=0.33 to z=3.6, with 29 detected in IRAC. Their rest-frame UV luminosity function, in contrast with previous JWST studies, shows that the number density of LRD candidates increases from high-z down to z=1.5-2.5 and decreases at even lower z. Less evolution is apparent focusing on the subsample of more robust LRD candidates having IRAC detections, which is affected by low statistics and limited by the IRAC resolution. The comparison with previous quasar UV luminosity functions shows that LRDs are not the dominant AGN population at z<4. Follow-up studies of these LRD candidates are key to confirm their nature, probe their physical properties and check for their compatibility with JWST sources, since the different spatial resolution and wavelength coverage of Euclid and JWST could select different samples of compact sources.}},

    abstract = {{The origin of the rest-optical emission of compact, red, high-redshift sources known as `little red dots' (LRDs) poses a major puzzle. If interpreted as starlight, it would imply that LRDs would constitute the densest stellar systems in the Universe. However, alternative models suggest active galactic nuclei (AGN) may instead power the rest-optical continuum. Here, we present JWST/NIRSpec, NIRCam and MIRI observations from the RUBIES and PRIMER programs of The Cliff: a bright LRD at $z=3.55$ with an exceptional Balmer break, twice as strong as that of any high- redshift source previously observed. The spectra also reveal broad Hydrogen (H$PLACEHOLDERalphaPLACEHOLDER \rm FWHM\sim1500$km/s) and He I emission, but no significant metal lines. We demonstrate that massive evolved stellar populations cannot explain the observed spectrum, even when considering unusually steep and strong dust attenuation, or reasonable variations in the initial mass function. Moreover, the formally best-fit stellar mass and compact size ($M\\\\\\_*\sim10^{10.5}\,M\\\\\\_\odot,\ r\\\\\\_{e}\sim40\,$pc) would imply densities at which near-monthly stellar collisions might lead to significant X-ray emission. We argue that the Balmer break, emission lines, and H$\alpha$ absorption line are instead most plausibly explained by a `black hole star' (BH*) scenario, in which dense gas surrounds a powerful ionising source. In contrast to recently proposed BH* models of dust-reddened AGN, we show that spectral fits in the rest UV to near-infrared favour an intrinsically redder continuum over strong dust reddening. This may point to a super-Eddington accreting massive black hole or, possibly, the presence of (super)massive stars in a nuclear star cluster. The Cliff is the clearest evidence to date that at least some LRDs are not ultra-dense, massive galaxies, and are instead powered by a central ionising source embedded in dense, absorbing gas.}},

Despite extensive study of their characteristic V-shaped SEDs, the nature of LRDs remains unknown. We present a new analysis of the NIRSpec/PRISM spectrum of A2744-QSO1, a triply imaged LRD at z = 7.04 from the UNCOVER survey. The spectrum shows a strong Balmer break and broad Balmer emission lines, both of which are difficult to explain with models invoking exclusively AGN or stellar contributions. Our fiducial model decomposes the spectrum into a post-starburst galaxy dominating the UV-optical continuum and a reddened AGN being subdominant at all wavelengths and contributing at a level of {\ensuremath{\sim}}20\\\\\\\%. However, this model infers a stellar mass of M$\\\\\\_{{\ensuremath{\star}}}$ {\ensuremath{\approx}} 4 {\texttimes} {}10$^{9}$ M$\\\\\\_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$ within a radius of r$\\\\\\_{e}$ < 30 pc, driving its central density to the highest among observations to date. This high central density could be explained if A2744-QSO1 is the early-forming core of a modern-day massive elliptical galaxy that later puffed up via the inside-out growth channel. The models also necessitate an unusually steep dust extinction law to preserve the strong break strength, though this steepness may be explained by a deficit of large dust grains. It is also probable that these challenges reflect our ignorance of A2744-QSO1's true nature. Future variability and reverberation mapping studies could help disentangle the galaxy and AGN contribution to the continuum, and deeper redder observations could also unveil the dust properties in LRDs. *The error code 404 in the title represents that no satisfying model is found for A2744-QSO 1. In computer network communication, the code ``404'' refers to the error occurring when the server cannot find the requested information.}},

The gravitational wave (GW) signals from mergers of these massive SMBHs can be detected by LISA while remaining within the NANOGrav constraints on the GW background. These results provide testable signatures of DM- driven SMBH formation, offering a pathway to probe hidden-sector physics through SMBH and GW observables.}},

    abstract = {{Recent observations have identified an abundance of high-redshift active galactic nuclei (AGN) with supermassive black holes (BHs) that are over-massive compared to the local BH mass$-$total stellar mass ($M\\\\\\_{\mathrm{BH}}-M\\\\\\_\star$) relation. $M\\\\\\_{\mathrm{BH}}$ measurements at high-$z$ are critical for probing the growth histories of BHs and their host galaxies, including BH seeding and evolution of the $M\\\\\\_{\mathrm{BH}}-M\\\\\\_\star$ relation. However, BH masses in high-$z$ AGN are generally estimated from single-epoch measurements, which are anchored to local relations based on reverberation mapping and carry large systematic uncertainties. Alternate $M\\\\\\_{\mathrm{BH}}$ detection methods such as dynamical measurements are more reliable but currently only possible in the local Universe or with strongly lensed systems. Recently, dynamical $M\\\\\\_{\mathrm{BH}}$ measurements were made in a $z\sim2$ lensed quiescent galaxy as well as a sample of six local galaxies identified as likely relics of common quiescent red nugget galaxies at cosmic noon. We compare the $z\sim2$ red nugget and relic BHs to recent results for $4<z<11$ AGN, quasars, and Little Red Dots. Intriguingly, the $z\sim2$ galaxy and local relic galaxies all lie on both the local $M\\\\\\_{\mathrm{BH}}-M\\\\\\_\star$ relation for bulges and the $4<z<7$ $M\\\\\\_{\mathrm{BH}}-M\\\\\\_\star$ relation. Our results suggest the $M\\\\\\_{\mathrm{BH}}-M\\\\\\_\star$ relation for bulges was likely in place at high-$z$ and indicate careful consideration of different evolutionary pathways is needed when building BH scaling relations. While improvements to $M\\\\\\_{\mathrm{BH}}$ estimates in AGN will increase our confidence in high-$z$ BH masses, detecting BHs in relic galaxies and lensed galaxies presents a complementary probe of the high-$z$ relations.}},

Using this model for cloud-scale SFEs, the galaxy forms stars stochastically, assembling most of its $10^6\textasciitilde {\rm M\\\\\\_\odot}$ in stars by redshift $z=8$ through two star-forming bursts (SFBs), each lasting $\sim10\textasciitilde {\rm Myr}$, separated by $80\textasciitilde {\rm Myr}$ of quiescence.

Star clusters follow a flat power-law mass function with slope $\Gamma \sim -0.4$. The most massive star clusters ($10^{4-5} \textasciitilde {\rm M\\\\\\_\odot}$) grow through mergers and have metallicity spreads of $0.05 - 0.1$ dex that roughly scale with mass. The second SFB forms loosely bound star clusters with higher metallicities: $-1.95 < \log(Z/{\rm Z\\\\\\_\odot}) < -1.50$ at lower SFEs ($2 - 20\\\\\\\%$). At $z \sim 8.7$, a nuclear star cluster (NSC) is seeded, growing $83\\\\\\\%$ of its mass ($ 2.4 \times 10^5 \textasciitilde {\rm M\\\\\\_\odot}$, $20\\\\\\\%$ of the galaxy's stellar mass) through mergers with pre-existing clusters and the rest through in-situ star formation. The early formation of NSCs has interesting implications for seeding supermassive black holes and the population of ``little red dots'' recently discovered by JWST at $z rsim 5$.}},

This mechanism is particularly promising for explaining the abundance of little red dots (LRDs) -- a population of early, apparently galaxy-less active galactic nuclei hosting supermassive BHs.

However, the lack of observed FIR emission has proved difficult to reconcile with the implied attenuated luminosity in these models. Here, we utilize deep new ALMA imaging, new and existing JWST/MIRI imaging, and archival Spitzer/Herschel imaging of two of the rest-optically brightest LRDs ($z=3.1$ and $z=4.47$) to place the strongest constraints on the IR luminosity in LRDs to date. The detections at $\lambda\\\\\\_\mathrm{rest}=1-4 \ \mu$m imply flat slopes in the rest-IR, ruling out a contribution from hot ($Trsim500$ K) dust. Similarly, FIR non-detections rule out any appreciable cold ($T\lesssim75$ K) dust component. Assuming energy balance, these observations are inconsistent with the typical FIR dust emission of dusty starbursts and quasar torii, which usually show a mixture of cold and hot dust. Additionally, our [$\mathrm{C}\\\\\\_{II}$] non-detections rule out typical dusty starbursts. We compute empirical maximum IR SEDs and find that both LRDs must have $\log(L\\\\\\_\mathrm{IR}/L\\\\\\_\odot) \lesssim 12.2$ at the $3\sigma$ level. These limits are in tension with the predictions of rest-optical spectrophotometric fits, be they galaxy only, AGN only, or composite. It is unlikely that LRDs are highly dust-reddened intrinsically blue sources with a dust temperature distribution that conspires to avoid current observing facilities. Rather, we favor an intrinsically redder LRD SED model that alleviates the need for strong dust attenuation.}},

Both satisfy the ``v-shape'' colors and compactness criteria for LRDs and are identified as Type-I AGN candidates based on their broad H$\beta$ emission lines (full width at half maximum: 2276$\pm$492 km/s for ID9094 and 1069$\pm$239 km/s for ID2756) and narrow [OI] lines ($\sim$ 300-400 km/s). To investigate their nature, we conduct deep NOEMA follow-up observations targeting the [CII] 158${\rm \mu m}$ emission line and the 1.3 mm dust continuum. We do not detect [CII] or 1.3 mm continuum emission for either source. Notably, in the scenario that the two LRDs were DSFGs, we would expect significant detections: $>16\sigma$ for [CII] and $>3\sigma$ for the 1.3 mm continuum of ID9094, and $>5\sigma$ for [CII] of ID2756. Using the 3$\sigma$ upper limits of [CII] and 1.3 mm, we perform two analyses: (1) UV-to-FIR spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting with and without AGN components, and (2) comparison of their properties with the L$\\\\\\_{[CII]}$-SFR$\\\\\\_{tot}$ empirical relation. Both analyses indicate that LRDs favor the presence of AGN to explain their observed properties.

Many of these sources have red colors and a compact appearance that has led to them being named ``little red dots''. In this paper, we develop a detailed framework to estimate the photometry of AGNs embedded in galaxies extracted from the OBELISK cosmological simulation to understand the properties of color-selected little red dots (cLRDs) in the context of the full AGN and massive black hole population. We find that using realistic spectral energy distributions (SEDs) and attenuation for AGNs we can explain the shape of the cLRD SED as long as galaxies host a sufficiently luminous AGN that is neither overly attenuated nor too little attenuated. When attenuation is too low or too high, AGNs do not enter the cLRD selection, because the AGN dominates over the host galaxy too much in blue filters, or it does not contribute to photometry anywhere, respectively. cLRDs are also characterized by high Eddington ratios, possibility super-Eddington ones, and/or high ratios between the black hole and the stellar mass.}},

    abstract = {{JWST has uncovered large numbers of compact galaxies at high redshift with broad hydrogen/helium lines. These include the enigmatic population known as ``little red dots'' (LRDs). Their nature is debated, but they are thought to be powered by supermassive black holes (SMBHs) or intense star formation. They exhibit unusual properties for SMBHs, such as black holes that are overmassive for their host galaxies and extremely weak X-ray and radio emission. Using the highest-quality JWST spectra, we show here that the lines are broadened by electron scattering with a narrow intrinsic line core. The data require high electron column densities and compact sizes (light days), which, when coupled with their high luminosities can only be explained by SMBH accretion. The narrow intrinsic cores of the lines imply upper limits on the black hole masses of $10^{5-7}$ $M\\\\\\_{\odot}$, two orders of magnitude lower than previous estimates. These are among the lowest mass SMBHs known at high redshift and suggest that this is a population of young, rapidly growing SMBHs. They are enshrouded in a dense cocoon of ionized gas, probably related to their youth, from which they are accreting close to the Eddington limit. Reprocessed nebular emission from the dense cocoon dominates the optical spectrum, explaining most LRD spectral characteristics and helping to suppress radio and X-ray emission.}},

Several theoretical scenarios have been proposed to seed and rapidly grow black holes, but direct observations of these mechanisms remain elusive. Here we present a source 660 million years after the Big Bang that displays singular properties: among the largest Hydrogen Balmer breaks reported at any redshift, broad multi-peaked H$\beta$ emission, and Balmer line absorption in multiple transitions. We model this source as a ``black hole star'' (BH*) where the Balmer break and absorption features are a result of extremely dense, turbulent gas forming a dust-free ``atmosphere'' around a supermassive black hole. This source may provide evidence of an early black hole embedded in dense gas -- a theoretical configuration proposed to rapidly grow black holes via super- Eddington accretion. Radiation from the BH* appears to dominate almost all observed light, leaving limited room for contribution from its host galaxy. We demonstrate that the recently discovered ``Little Red Dots'' (LRDs) with perplexing spectral energy distributions can be explained as BH*s embedded in relatively brighter host galaxies. This source provides evidence that black hole masses in the LRDs may be over-estimated by orders of magnitude -- the BH* is effectively dust-free contrary to the steep dust corrections applied while modeling LRDs, and the physics that gives rise to the complex line shapes and luminosities may deviate from assumptions underlying standard scaling relations.}},

The observations are part of the JWST Cycle-3 treasury program, Slitless Areal Pure-Parallel HIgh-Redshift Emission Survey (SAPPHIRES) with NIRCam-grism. Using wide field slitless spectroscopy (WFSS) obtained in the MACS0416 parallel field, we robustly confirm nine galaxies at $z\\\\\\_{\rm spec}\sim8.47$ via emission line detections of [OIII]5008A (with $>5\,\sigma$) and tentatively confirm one additional galaxy (at $\sim3\,\sigma$). This discovery represents the highest-redshift, spectroscopically confirmed galaxy over-density known to date, which is $\sim6$--$8$ times more dense than the average volume density of galaxies at the same redshift. Furthermore, a galaxy hosting a low-mass active galactic nucleus (``Little-Red-Dot'') is found as a member, suggesting an early emergence of active, massive black holes and feedback between these black holes and their surrounding environments. We also discuss the spatial structures connecting the galaxy over-density to nearby massive star- forming galaxies (separated by $\sim 5$pMpc, including MACS0416-Y1 and MACS0416-JD. This finding of a massive dark matter halo hosting a galaxy over-density at $z\sim8.5$ is surprising given that our survey covered only a small, random field ($16.5\,{\rm arcmin^2}$) as part of a pure parallel observation. The comparison with cosmological simulations shows that the likelihood of finding such a large-scale structure is $<5\,\\\\\\\%$ under the current galaxy formation scenario and the observed survey volume. Our results demonstrate the power of WFSS observations to build a complete line-emitter sample and suggest an important role for over-densities in enhancing galaxy formation by funneling large-scale gas supplies into small cosmological volumes.}},

    abstract = {{JWST spectroscopy has revealed a population of compact objects at redshifts $z=2$-9 with `v'-shaped spectral energy distributions, broad permitted lines, and, often, hydrogen Balmer absorption. Among these `Little Red Dots' (LRDs), Abell2744-QSO1 at $z=7.04$ has been confirmed to have time-variable equivalent width (EW) in its broad emission lines, confirming its AGN nature. We extend the analysis of NIRSpec/IFS data from the BlackTHUNDER survey to the H$\alpha$ line. The broad-line profile in Abell2744-QSO1 is manifestly non-Gaussian, requiring at least two Gaussian components with full width at half maximum FWHM=$450\pm50$ and $1800\pm100$ km s$^{-1}$. Crucially, we also detect a narrow-line Gaussian component, and strong H$\alpha$ absorption (EW relative to the continuum $\approx 30^{+15}\\\\\\_{-9}$ A), confirming a connection between the strong Balmer break and line absorption. The absorber is at rest with respect to broad H$\alpha$, suggesting that the gas cannot be interpreted as an inflow or outflow, forming instead a long-lived structure. Its velocity dispersion is $\sigma\\\\\\_{abs} = 100\pm10$ km s$^{-1}$, consistent with the value inferred from the analysis of the Balmer break. Based on H$\alpha$, we infer a black hole mass of log(M$\\\\\\_{BH}$/M$\\\\\\_\odot$)=6.3-6.7, 0.9-1.3 dex smaller than previous estimates based on H$\beta$. The Eddington ratio is 0.7-1.6. Combining the high signal-to-noise ratio of the narrow H$\alpha$ line with the spectral resolution R=3,700 of the G395H grating, we infer a narrow-line dispersion $\sigma\\\\\\_n = 22^{+5}\\\\\\_{-6}$ km s$^{-1}$, which places a stringent constraint on the black-hole-to-dynamical-mass ratio of this system to be M$\\\\\\_{BH}$/M$\\\\\\_{dyn}$>0.02-0.4. If M$\\\\\\_{BH}$ is near the low-mass end of our estimates, the SMBH would be accreting at a super- Eddington rate. Alternatively, at the high-M$\\\\\\_{BH}$ end, there would be minimal room for a host galaxy.}},

One remarkable distinction of these JWST-identified AGNs, compared to their low-redshift counterparts, is that at least {\ensuremath{\sim}}20\\\\\\\% of them present H{\ensuremath{\alpha}} and/or H{\ensuremath{\beta}} absorption, which must be associated with extremely dense ({\ensuremath{\gtrsim}}{}10$^{9}$ cm$^{‑3}$) gas in the broad- line region or its immediate surroundings. These Balmer absorption features unavoidably imply the presence of a Balmer break caused by the same dense gas. In this Letter, we quantitatively demonstrate that a Balmer break can form in AGN spectra without stellar components, when the accretion disk is heavily embedded in dense neutral gas clumps with densities of {\ensuremath{\sim}}10$^{9‑11}$ cm$^{‑3}$, where hydrogen atoms are collisionally excited to the n = 2 states and effectively absorb the AGN continuum at the bluer side of the Balmer limit. The nonstellar origin of a Balmer break offers a potential solution to the large stellar masses and densities inferred for little red dots (LRDs) when assuming that their continuum is primarily due to stellar light. Our calculations indicate that the observed Balmer absorption blueshifted by a few hundred km s$^{‑1}$, which suggests the presence of dense outflows in the nucleus at rates exceeding the Eddington value. Other spectral features such as higher equivalent widths of broad H{\ensuremath{\alpha}} emission and presence of O I lines observed in high-redshift AGNs including LRDs align with the predicted signatures of a dense super-Eddington accretion disk.}},

It is very likely that LRDs host obscured broad-line active galactic nuclei (AGNs). In the meanwhile, Green Pea galaxies (GPs), which are compact dwarf galaxies at low redshift, share various similar properties with high-redshift star-forming galaxies. Here, we aim to find the connection between the LRDs and GPs hosting broad-line AGNs (BLGPs). With a sample of 19 BLGPs obtained from our previous work, we further identify seven GPs with V-shaped rest-frame UV- to-optical SEDs that are likely local analogs to LRDs. These V-shaped BLGPs exhibit faint UV absolute magnitudes and sub- Eddington rates similar to those of LRDs. Three of them occupy a similar region to LRDs in the Baldwin{\textendash}Philips{\textendash}Terlevich diagram, suggesting they have similar ionization conditions and gas-phase metallicities to LRDs. These similarities suggest that V-shaped BLGPs can be taken as local analogs of high-redshift LRDs. In addition, most (16/19) BLGPs, including six V-shaped BLGPs, host overmassive black holes (BHs) above the local M$\\\\\\_{BH}${\textendash}M$\\\\\\_{*}$ relation, making it the first sample of galaxies hosting overmassive BHs at z < 0.4.

As a subsample of these sources, commonly called ``little red dots'' (LRDs), have been spectroscopically observed to host a broad- line active galactic nucleus (AGN), they have been the focus of multiple recent studies in an attempt to understand the origin of their UV and optical emission. Here, we assemble a sample of 123 LRDs from the literature along with spectroscopic and photometric JWST-identified samples of AGNs to compare their colors and spectral slopes. We find that while obscured AGNs at z < 6 have highly dissimilar colors to LRDs, unobscured AGNs at z < 6 span a wide range of colors, with only a subsample showing colors similar to LRDs. At z > 6, the majority of the unobscured AGNs that have been found in these samples are LRDs, but this may be related to the fact that these sources are at large bolometric luminosities. Because LRDs occupy a unique position in galaxy color space, they are more straightforward to target, and the large number of broad-line AGNs that do not have LRD colors and slopes are therefore underrepresented in many spectroscopic surveys because they are more difficult to preselect. Current LRD selection techniques return a large and disparate population, including many sources having 2{\textendash}5 {\ensuremath{\mu}}m colors impacted by emission- line flux boosting in individual filters.}},

Their unique V-shaped spectral feature, characterized by a red optical continuum and a UV excess in the rest frame, challenges us to discern the relative contributions of the galaxy and AGN. We study a spectral energy distribution (SED) model for LRDs from rest-frame UV to infrared bands. We hypothesize that the incident radiation from an AGN, characterized by a typical SED, is embedded in an extended dusty medium with an extinction law similar to those seen in dense regions such as Orion Nebula or certain AGN environments. The UV‑optical spectrum is described by dust-attenuated AGN emission, featuring a red optical continuum at {\ensuremath{\lambda}} > 4000 {\r{A}} and a flat UV spectral shape established through a gray extinction curve at {\ensuremath{\lambda}} < 3000 {\r{A}}, due to the absence of small-size grains. There is no need for additional stellar emission or AGN scattered light. In the infrared, the SED is shaped by an extended dust and gas distribution ({\ensuremath{\gamma}} < 1; {\ensuremath{\rho}} {\ensuremath{\propto}} r$^{‑{\ensuremath{\gamma}}}$) with characteristic gas densities of ≃10{\textendash}{}10$^{3}$ cm$^{‑3}$, which allows relatively cool dust temperatures to dominate the radiation. As a result, these dust structures shift the emission energy peak from near-infrared to mid-infrared bands in the rest frame; for sources at z \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde 4{\textendash}7, the corresponding wavelengths shift from the JWST/MIRI to Herschel range. This model, unlike the typical AGN hot torus models, can produce an infrared SED flattening that is consistent with LRD observations through JWST MIRI. Such a density structure can arise from the coexistence of inflows and outflows during the early assembly of galactic nuclei. This might be the reason why LRDs emerge preferentially in the high-redshift Universe younger than 1 billion years.}},

Among the most intriguing JWST discoveries are red, very compact objects that show broad line emission features, nicknamed little red dots (LRDs). The discovery of LRDs has triggered great interest in their origin as either extremely starbursting galaxies or highly obscured active galactic nuclei (AGNs). Their exact nature remains unknown. Aims. The goal of this work is to estimate the radio emission from LRDs and predict which radio surveys would detect them. To achieve these objectives, we employed the fundamental plane of black hole (BH) accretion to estimate radio emission from AGNs and the stellar radio fluxes from their host galaxies. We assumed a range of BH masses, X-ray luminosities (L$\\\\\\_{X}$), and star formation rates (SFRs) to bracket the likely properties of LRDs. Methods. Our findings suggest that BH radio fluxes from LRDs are 10{\textendash}100 times higher than the stellar fluxes from their host galaxies, depending on the BH mass, L$\\\\\\_{X}$, and SFR. The detection of a {\ensuremath{\sim}}500 nJy signal above 2 GHz at z {\ensuremath{\geq}} 5 or a {\ensuremath{\sim}}2000 nJy flux at z = 3{\textendash}4 would be a smoking gun for the presence of AGNs provided that SFRs in the host galaxies are < 30 M$\\\\\\_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$ yr$^{‑1}$. Results. We find that LRDs are most likely radio-quiet AGNs; otherwise, they would have already been detected in the current radio surveys. Our findings suggest that LRDs can be detected with upcoming radio observatories such as ngVLA and SKA with integration times of 10{\textendash}100 h, respectively.}},

    abstract = {{JWST observations have uncovered a new population of red, compact objects at high redshifts dubbed 'Little Red Dots' (LRDs), which typically show broad emission lines and are thought to be dusty Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN). Some of their other features, however, challenge the AGN explanation, such as prominent Balmer breaks and extremely faint or even missing metal high-ionization lines, X-ray, or radio emission, including in deep stacks. Time variability is a unique test of AGN activity. Here, we exploit the $z=7.045$ multiply-imaged LRD A2744-QSO1, which offers a unique test of variability due to lensing-induced time delays between the three images spanning 22 yr (2.7 yr in the rest- frame), to investigate its photometric and spectroscopic variability. We find the equivalent widths (EWs) of the broad H$\alpha$ and H$\beta$ lines, which are independent of magnification and other systematics, to exhibit significant variations, up to $18\pm3$ \\\\\\\% for H$\alpha$ and up to $22\pm8$ \\\\\\\% in H$\beta$, on a timescale of 875 d (2.4 yr) in the rest- frame. This suggests that A2744-QSO1 is indeed an AGN. We find no significant photometric variability beyond the limiting systematic uncertainties, so it currently cannot be determined whether the EW variations are due to line-flux or continuum variability. These results are consistent with a typical damped random walk (DRW) variability model for an AGN like A2744-QSO1 ($M\\\\\\_{\mathrm{BH}}=4\times10^7 \mathrm{M}\\\\\\_{\odot}$) given the sparse sampling of the light-curve with the available data. Our results therefore support the AGN interpretation of this LRD, and highlight the need for further photometric and spectroscopic monitoring in order to build a detailed and reliable light- curve.}},

These LRDs are massive ($M\\\\\\_\star\sim10^{10}\,M\\\\\\_\odot$) and dusty (A(V) $>1$ mag) whereas the three satellites are lower-mass objects ($M\\\\\\_\star\sim10^{8-9}\,M\\\\\\_\odot$) subject to low dust attenuations. The spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of this LRD pair show strong evidence for a Balmer Break, consistent with a recent ($\sim 100$ Myr) quenching of star formation. In contrast, the satellites are compatible with a recent-onset ($\sim 100$ Myr), ongoing burst of star formation. LRD1's SED is consistent with a dust-free AGN as the source of the UV excess in the galaxy. The optical continuum would be powered by the emission from an obscured post-starburst and the AGN at a subdominant level. LRD2's SED is more ambiguous to interpret, but it could also be indicative of a dust-free AGN. The proximity of the two LRDs suggests that their interaction may be responsible for their recent star formation histories, which can be interpreted as environmental bursting and quenching in the Epoch of Reionization.}},

In this study, we search for radio bright sources in a large sample of $\sim$700 JWST discovered AGN candidates ($z\sim2-11$) in the 0.144-3 GHz frequency range, utilizing deep radio imaging in COSMOS, GOODS-N, and GOODS-S. Only one source is significantly detected in our radio surveys, which is PRIMER-COS 3866 at $z=4.66$. Its radio properties are consistent with both an AGN and star formation origin with a spectral index of $\alpha=-0.76^{+0.11}\\\\\\_{-0.09}$ and a radio-loudness of $R\approx0.5$. The derived brightness temperature limit of PRIMER-COS 3866 of $T\\\\\\_b rsim 10^{3}$ K is too low to confirm its AGN nature. Our stacking results yield non-detections in all fields with the most constraining 3$\sigma$ limit $L\\\\\\_{1.3\text{GHz}} < 1.3\times10^{39}$ erg s$^{-1}$ (rms of $\sim$0.15 $\mu$Jy beam$^{-1}$ at $z\\\\\\_{\text{median}}=6.1$) obtained for photometrically selected AGN candidates in the COSMOS field. This result is still consistent with expectations from the empirical $L\\\\\\_X - L\\\\\\_{\text{H}\alpha}$ and $L\\\\\\_X - L\\\\\\_R$ correlations established for local AGN. We conclude that current radio observations have insufficient depth to claim JWST discovered AGN candidates are radio-weak. We project that future surveys carried out by the SKA and ngVLA should be able to obtain significant detections within a few hours, providing crucial measurements of their brightness temperature, which would allow for distinguishing between AGN and starburst-driven origins of this new abundant population.}},

    abstract = {{Recent observations from JWST have revealed an abundant population of active galactic nuclei (AGN) and so-called ``Little Red Dots'' (LRDs) at $2\lesssim z \lesssim 11$, many of which are characterized by V-shaped UV-to-optical continua with turnovers around the Balmer limit. The physical nature of these LRDs is unclear, and it remains debated whether the peculiar spectral shape originates from AGN, compact galaxies, or both. We present the analysis of new NIRSpec-IFU data from the BlackTHUNDER JWST Large Programme and archival NIRSpec-MSA data of a lensed LRD at $z=7.04$. The spectra confirm the presence of a smooth Balmer break and a broad H$\beta$ tracing the Broad Line Region (BLR) of an AGN. The small velocity dispersion of the H$\beta$ narrow component indicates a small dynamical mass of the host galaxy of $M\\\\\\_{\rm dyn}<4 \times 10^8\textasciitilde M\\\\\\_{\odot}$, which implies that the stellar population cannot contribute more than 10\\\\\\\% to the optical continuum. We show that the Balmer break can be well described by an AGN continuum absorbed by very dense ($n\\\\\\_{\rm H}\sim 10^{10}\textasciitilde {\rm cm^{-3}}$) and nearly dust-free gas along our line-of-sight (possibly gas in the BLR or its surrounding). The same gas is expected to produce H$\beta$ absorption, at a level consistent with a tentative detection ($3\sigma$) in the high-resolution spectrum. Such a non-stellar origin of the Balmer break may apply to other LRDs, and would alleviate the issue of extremely high stellar mass surface densities inferred in the case of a stellar interpretation of the Balmer break. We note that this is a rare case of a black hole that is overmassive relative to both the host galaxy stellar and dynamical masses. We finally report indications of variability and the first attempt of AGN reverberation mapping at such an early epoch.}},

We show that even under very conservative assumptions almost all growth of SMBH mass at z>6 does not take place in these UV- luminous quasars, but must occur in systems obscured through dust and/or with lower radiative efficiency than standard thin accretion disks. The 'Soltan argument' is not fulfilled by the known population of bright quasars at z>6: the integrated SMBH mass growth inferred from these largely unobscured active galactic nuclei (AGN) in the early Universe is by a factor $$10 smaller than the total SMBH mass volume density at z=6. This is valid under a large range of assumption about luminosity, mass functions, and accretion modes, and is likely still a factor >2 smaller when accounting for known obscuration fractions at this epoch. The resulting consequences are: >90\\\\\\\%, possibly substantially more, of SMBH-buildup in the early Universe does not take place in luminous unobscured quasar phases, but has to occur in obscured systems, with dust absorbing most of the emitted UV-visible AGN emission, potentially with accretion modes with super-Eddington specific accretion rates. This is consistent with short lifetimes for luminous quasar phases from quasar proximity zone studies and clustering. This would remove the empirical need for slow SMBH growth and hence exotic 'high- mass seed' black holes at early cosmic time. It also predicts a large population of luminous but very obscured lower-mass quasars at z>6, possibly the JWST 'Little Red Dots'.}},

    abstract = {{By analyzing data from DESI Legacy Imaging Survey of the dwarf galaxies in the Arecibo Legacy Fast Alfa Survey, we have identified five ultradiffuse galaxies (UDGs) featuring central pseudobulges. These UDGs display blue pseudobulges with S{\'e}rsic indices n < 2.5 and effective radii spanning 300{\textendash}700 pc, along with bluer thin stellar disks exhibiting low surface brightness and expansive effective radii that align with the UDG definition. The rotation velocities of these UDGs, determined using H I line widths and optical inclinations, exceed those of most dwarf galaxies of similar mass, suggesting the high halo spins or substantial dark matter halos. We propose that these UDGs likely formed through mergers of dwarf galaxies lacking old stars in their progenitors, resulting in the development of central bulge-like structures during starbursts triggered by the mergers while also enhancing their halo spin. Subsequent gas accretion facilitated the formation of extended stellar disks. It is also worth noting the possibility that these UDGs could alternatively represent ``failed L$^{{\ensuremath{\star}}}$ galaxies'' with massive dark matter halos but reduced star formation efficiencies. If future high-resolution H I observations confirm the presence of massive halos around these UDGs, they may have formed due to intense AGN feedback in the early Universe and may be the descendants of ``little red dots'' observed by the James Webb Space Telescope, which are characterized by heightened central black hole masses and intensified accretion and feedback processes in the early Universe.}},

The first star formation in the universe occurs in dense clusters, some of which may undergo runaway collapse and form an intermediate mass black hole. This process would appear as a very dense stellar system, with recurring tidal disruption events (TDEs) as stellar material is accreted by the black hole. Such a system would be compact, UV-emitting, and exhibit broad H-alpha emission. If runaway collapse is the primary mechanism for forming massive black hole seeds, this process could be fairly common and explain the large volume densities of LRDs. In order to match the predicted number density of runaway collapse clusters, the tidal disruption rate must be on the order of 10\^-4 per year. A top-heavy stellar initial mass function may be required to match observations without exceeding the predicted LambdaCDM mass function. The TDE LRD hypothesis can be verified with followup JWST observations looking for TDE-like variability.}},

We investigate the impact of spectral energy distribution fitting methods, assumed star formation histories (SFHs), dust laws, and priors on galaxy masses and the resultant GSMF. While our fiducial GSMF agrees with the literature at z < 13.5, we find that the assumed SFH model has a large impact on the GSMF and stellar mass density (SMD), finding a 0.75 dex increase in the SMD at z = 10.5 between a flexible nonparametric and standard parametric SFH. Overall, we find a flatter SMD evolution at z {\ensuremath{\geq}} 9 than some studies predict, suggesting a rapid buildup of stellar mass in the early Universe. We find no incompatibility between our results and those of standard cosmological models, as suggested previously, although the most massive galaxies may require a high star formation efficiency. We find that the ``little red dot'' galaxies dominate the z = 7 GSMF at high masses, necessitating a better understanding of the relative contributions of active galactic nucleus and stellar emission. We show that assuming a theoretically motivated top-heavy initial mass function (IMF) reduces stellar mass by 0.5 dex without affecting fit quality, but our results remain consistent with existing cosmological models with a standard IMF.}},

Of the 20 sources with deep Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) 1.2 mm coverage, none are detected individually or in a stack. For the majority of the sample, spectral energy distribution fits to the JWST+ALMA observations prefer models with hot dust rather than obscured star formation to reproduce the red NIRCam colors and ALMA 1.2 mm nondetections. While compact dusty star formation cannot be ruled out, the combination of extremely small sizes (<r $\\\\\\_{ e }$> {\ensuremath{\approx}} 50 pc after correction for magnification), red rest-frame optical slopes, and hot dust can be explained by reddened broad-line active galactic nuclei (AGNs).

These objects are likely compact dusty starbursts or heavily reddened AGNs, playing a pivotal role in early black hole growth, dust production, and stellar assembly. We introduce a new photometric selection to identify LRDs over a broad range in redshifts and rest-frame UV-to-NIR colors enabling a more complete census of the population. This method identifies 248 LRDs with F444W$<27$ mag over 263 arcmin$^2$ in the JADES, PRIMER-COSMOS, and UDS fields with MIRI coverage, increasing the number density by $\times$1.7 compared to previous samples, suggesting that previous census were underestimated. Most LRDs are detected in MIRI/F770W but only 7\\\\\\\% (17) are detected in F1800W. We use MIRI-based rest-frame [1$-$3 $\mu$m] colors to trace dust emission. F1800W-detected LRDs have a median [1$-$3 $\mu$m]$=1.5$ mag, with a broad scatter indicative of diverse dust emission properties. About 20\\\\\\\% exhibit [1$-$3 $\mu$m]$<1$ mag colors consistent with negligible dust emission, but the majority show significant dust emission at 3 $\mu$m (f$^{\rm dust}\\\\\\_{3\mu m}\lesssim0.8$) from the galaxy ISM or a hot-dust- deficient AGN torus. A correlation between bluer UV-to-NIR colors and stronger IR emission suggests that the bluest LRDs may resemble unobscured QSOs. We report a LRD at $z\\\\\\_{\rm spec}=3.1386$, detected in MIRI, Spitzer/MIPS, and Herschel/PACS. Its IR SED rises steeply at $\lambda\\\\\\_{\rm rest}>6\textasciitilde \mu$m and peaks near $\sim40\textasciitilde \mu$m, providing the first direct evidence of warm dust emission (T$=50-100$ K) in a LRD.}},

    abstract = {{The recent discovery of little red dots - a population of extremely compact and highly dust-reddened high redshift galaxies - by the James Webb Space Telescope presents a new challenge to the fields of astrophysics and cosmology. Their remarkably high luminosities at redshifts 5 < z < 10, appear to challenge LambdaCDM cosmology and galaxy formation models, as they imply stellar masses and star formation rates that exceed the upper limits set by these models. LRDs are currently subjects of debate as the mechanisms behind their high luminosities are not yet fully understood. LRD energy outputs are thought to be either dominated by star formation or their energy output results from the hosting of active galactic nuclei. We investigate the starburst hypothesis by attempting to replicate the stellar properties of LRDs using output data from the FLARES simulation suite. Comparative analysis of galactic properties such as galactic number density, stellar mass and star formation rate yield significant tension between simulated and observed galaxies. The FLARES simulation overestimates the number densities of galaxies with stellar masses similar to observed LRDs by several orders of magnitude. Additionally, the simulation shows an overestimation of star formation rates. These tensions suggest a potential underestimation by the FLARES model of stellar feedback mechanisms such as active galactic nuclei feedback. These results suggest that the starburst hypothesis may be insufficient to explain the observed properties of these galaxies. Instead, the AGN scenario should be further investigated by repeating the methods in this study with a hydrodynamic galaxy simulation suite that models a higher influence of AGN feedback mechanisms on stellar activity in high redshift galaxies.}},

    abstract = {{The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has recently discovered a new population of objects at high redshift referred to as `Little Red Dots' (LRDs). Their nature currently remains elusive, despite their surprisingly high inferred number densities. This emerging population of red point-like sources is reshaping our view of the early Universe and may shed light on the formation of high-redshift supermassive black holes. Here we present a spectroscopically confirmed LRD CANUCS-LRD-z8.6 at $z\\\\\\_{\rm spec}=8.6319\pm 0.0005$ hosting an Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN), using JWST data. This source shows the typical spectral shape of an LRD (blue UV and red optical continuum, unresolved in JWST imaging), along with broad H$\beta$ line emission, detection of high-ionization emission lines (CIV, NIV]) and very high electron temperature indicative of the presence of AGN. This is also combined with a very low metallicity ($Z<0.1 Z\\\\\\_\odot$). The presence of all these diverse features in one source makes CANUCS-LRD-z8.6 unique. We show that the inferred black hole mass of CANUCS-LRD-z8.6 ($M\\\\\\_{\rm BH}=1.0^{+0.6}\\\\\\_{-0.4}\times 10^{8}\rm \textasciitilde M\\\\\\_\odot$) strongly challenges current standard theoretical models and simulations of black hole formation, and forces us to adopt `ad hoc' prescriptions. Indeed if massive seeds, or light seeds with super-Eddington accretion, are considered, the observed BH mass of CANUCS-LRD-z8.6 at $z=8.6$ can be reproduced. Moreover, the black hole is over-massive compared to its host, relative to the local $M\\\\\\_{\rm BH}-M\\\\\\_*$ relations, pointing towards an earlier and faster evolution of the black hole compared to its host galaxy.}},

    abstract = {{``Little Red Dots'' (LRDs) are an abundant high-redshift population newly discovered by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). They are characterized by a red color in the rest-frame optical band, compact morphology, and broad Balmer emission lines (${\rm FWHM} rsim 1000\textasciitilde {\rm km\,s^{-1}}$) that suggest an AGN nature. Using a method of pixel-by-pixel color selection and relaxing the compactness criteria, we identify three of the first dual LRD candidates in the COSMOS-Web survey with projected separations of $0.\!\!^{\prime\prime}2-0.\!\!^{\prime\prime}4$ (1-2 pkpc at their photometric redshifts). A comparison between existing LRD samples and mock data reveals that the projected separations of these dual LRD candidates are unlikely to result from chance projections of objects at different redshifts. In one case (CW-B5-15958), the dual LRD includes two bright sources ($m\\\\\\_{\rm F444W}=24.3$ and $24.8$) with characteristic V-shape spectral energy distribution (SEDs) and photometric redshifts consistent with each other. We find that CW-B5-15958 has a faint off- centered component and a companion galaxy. In the other two dual systems, the brighter LRD exhibits a V-shape SED, while the fainter LRD ($m\\\\\\_{\rm F444W}rsim26$) is undetected in both F115W and F150W. These discoveries suggest that the angular auto- correlation function (ACF) of LRDs exhibits a significant excess ($\sim3\times10^2$ times) on sub-arcsec (kilo-parsec) separations compared to the extrapolation of a power-law ACF of JWST-found AGNs measured over $10^{\prime\prime}-100^{\prime\prime}$. Follow-up spectroscopic confirmation of their redshifts and the construction of a larger sample are essential to advance our understanding of the evolution of supermassive black holes and the importance of mergers in the early universe.}},

    abstract = {{Context. High-redshift observations of {}10$^{9}$ M$\\\\\\_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$ supermassive black holes (SMBHs) at z {\ensuremath{\sim}} 7 and 'little red dots' that may host over- massive black holes (BHs) at z > 4 suggests the existence of so- called heavy seeds (> 1000 M$\\\\\\_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$) in the early Universe. Recent work has suggested that the rapid assembly of halos may be the key to forming heavy seeds early enough in the Universe to match such observations, as the high rate of accretion into the halo suppresses the cooling ability of H$\\\\\\_{2}$, allowing it to quickly accrete up to the atomic cooling limit of {}10$^{7}$ M$\\\\\\_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$ prior to the run-away collapse of baryonic gas within its dark matter (DM) potential, without the need for extreme radiation fields or DM streaming velocities. Aims. While the rapid assembly of halos can lead to increased halo masses upon the onset of collapse, it remains unclear if this leads to higher-mass BH seeds. As a common route for halos to grow rapidly is via halo-halo mergers, we aim to test what effects such a merger occurring during the initial gas collapse has on the formation of BH seeds. Methods. We performed simulations of BH seed formation in four distinct idealised halo collapse scenarios: an isolated {}10$^{6}$ M$\\\\\\_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$ minihalo, an isolated {}10$^{7}$ M$\\\\\\_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$ atomic halo, the direct collision of two {}10$^{7}$ M$\\\\\\_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$ halos, and a fly-by collision of two {}10$^{7}$ M$\\\\\\_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$ halos. We simulated the collapse of the gas down to scales of {\ensuremath{\sim}}0.0075 pc before inserting sink particles as BH seeds and captured a further 10 Myr of accretion. Results. We have shown that halo collisions create a central environment of increased density, inside which BH seeds can accrete at higher rates. For direct collisions, the gas density peaks are disrupted by the interaction, as the collisionless DM peaks pass through each other while the colliding gas is left in the centre, removing the BH from its accretion source. When the central density peaks instead experience a fly-by interaction, the BH remains embedded in the dense gas and maintains higher accretion rates throughout the simulated period compared to the isolated halo cases. The total simulated period was 70 Myr, and we followed the evolution of the BH for the final 10 Myr. The BH spends the final 6 Myr embedded in the dense, shocked region. The final mass of the BH is a factor of 2 greater than in the isolated atomic halo case, and a factor of 3 greater than the minihalo case, reaching {}10$^{4}$ M$\\\\\\_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$ via its 0.03 pc accretion radius. As the maximum halo mass before collapse is determined by the atomic cooling limit of a few times {}10$^{7}$ M$\\\\\\_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$, the ability of halo-halo mergers to further boost the rates of accretion onto the central object may play a crucial role in growing SMBH seeds, which is needed to explain recent observations of seemingly over-massive BHs at high redshifts.}},

    abstract = {{Early JWST studies found an apparent population of massive, compact galaxies at redshifts z {\ensuremath{\gtrsim}} 7. Recently three of these galaxies were shown to have prominent Balmer breaks, demonstrating that their light at {\ensuremath{\lambda}}$\\\\\\_{rest}$ {\ensuremath{\sim}} 3500 {\r{A}} is dominated by a stellar population that is relatively old ({\ensuremath{\sim}}200 Myr). All three also have broad H{\ensuremath{\beta}} emission with {\ensuremath{\sigma}} > 1000 km s$^{‑1}$, a common feature of such ``little red dots.'' From S{\'e}rsic profile fits to the Near Infrared Camera images in F200W we find that the stellar light of galaxies is extremely compact: the galaxies have half-light radii of r$\\\\\\_{e}$ {\ensuremath{\sim}} 100 pc, in the regime of ultracompact dwarfs in the nearby Universe. Their masses are uncertain, as they depend on the contribution of possible light from an active galactic nucleus (AGN) to the flux at {\ensuremath{\lambda}}$\\\\\\_{rest}$ > 5000 {\r{A}}. If the AGN contribution is low beyond the Balmer break region, the masses are M$\\\\\\_{*}$ {\ensuremath{\sim}} {}10$^{10}${\textendash}{}10$^{11}$ M$\\\\\\_{☉}$, and the central densities are higher than those of any other known galaxy population by 1 order of magnitude. Interestingly, the implied velocity dispersions of {\ensuremath{\sim}}1500 km s$^{‑1}$ are in very good agreement with the measured H{\ensuremath{\beta}} line widths. We suggest that some of the broad lines in ``little red dots'' are not due to AGNs, but simply reflect the kinematics of the galaxies, and speculate that the galaxies are observed in a short-lived phase where the central densities are much higher than at later times. We stress, however, that the canonical interpretation of AGNs causing the broad H{\ensuremath{\beta}} lines also remains viable.}},

    abstract = {{JWST observations have opened a new chapter in supermassive black hole (SMBH) studies, stimulating discussion of two puzzles: the abundance of high-z SMBHs and the fraction of dual active galactic nuclei (AGNs). We argue that the answers to these puzzles may be linked to an interpretation of the data on the nanohertz gravitational waves (GWs) discovered by NANOGrav and other pulsar timing arrays as SMBH binaries whose evolution is driven by interactions with their environments down to O(0.1 pc) separations. We show that the stellar mass-black hole mass correlations found in JWST data and in low-ɀ inactive galaxies are similar, and present a global fit to these data, excluding low-ɀ AGNs. Matching the NANOGrav and dual-AGN data requires that binary evolution due to environmental effects at separations below O(1 kpc) be rapid on cosmological timescales. According to this interpretation, the SMBHs in low-ɀ AGNs are the tip of the iceberg of a local SMBH population in mainly inactive galaxies. This interpretation is consistent with the 'little red dots' observed with JWST being AGNs, and would favour the observability of GW signals from black hole binaries in LISA and decihertz GW detectors.}},

J0647\\\\\\\_1045 is unresolved (r$\\\\\\_{e}$ {\ensuremath{\lesssim}} 0.17 kpc) in the three NIRCam long-wavelength filters but significantly extended (r$\\\\\\_{e}$ = 0.45 {\ensuremath{\pm}} 0.06 kpc) in the three short- wavelength filters, indicating a red compact source in a blue star-forming galaxy. The spectral continuum shows a clear change in slope, from blue in the optical/UV to red in the rest-frame optical/NIR, which is consistent with two distinct components fit by power laws with different attenuations: A$\\\\\\_{V}$ = 0.38 {\ensuremath{\pm}} 0.01 (UV) and A$\\\\\\_{V}$ = 5.61 {\ensuremath{\pm}} 0.04 (optical/NIR). Fitting the H{\ensuremath{\alpha}} line requires both broad (full width at half maximum of {\ensuremath{\sim}}4300 {\ensuremath{\pm}} 100 km s$^{‑1}$) and narrow components, but none of the other emission lines, including H{\ensuremath{\beta}}, show evidence of broadness. We calculated A$\\\\\\_{V}$ = 0.9 {\ensuremath{\pm}} 0.4 from the Balmer decrement using narrow H{\ensuremath{\alpha}} and H{\ensuremath{\beta}} and A$\\\\\\_{V}$ > 4.1 {\ensuremath{\pm}} 0.1 from broad H{\ensuremath{\alpha}} and an upper limit on broad H{\ensuremath{\beta}}, which is consistent with blue and red continuum attenuation, respectively.

Our findings are consistent with a multi-component model, in which the optical/NIR and broad lines arise from a highly obscured, spatially unresolved region, likely a relatively massive active galactic nucleus, while the less obscured UV continuum and narrow lines arise, at least partly, from a small but spatially resolved star-forming host galaxy.}},

The origin of this excess is still under debate, although several possibilities have been presented. We propose that gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are a powerful probe to explore the origin of the excess and, hence, the star and galaxy formation histories in the early universe. Focusing on the recently launched mission, Einstein Probe (EP), we find that EP can detect several GRBs annually at z {\ensuremath{\gtrsim}} 10, assuming the GRB formation rate calibrated by events at z {\ensuremath{\lesssim}} 6 can be extrapolated. Interestingly, depending on the excess scenarios, the GRB event rate may also show an excess at z ≃ 10, and its detection will help to discriminate between the scenarios that are otherwise difficult to distinguish. Additionally, we discuss that the puzzling, red-color, compact galaxies discovered by JWST, the so-called ``little red dots,'' could host dark GRBs if they are dust-obscured star-forming galaxies. We are eager for unbiased follow-up of GRBs and encourage future missions such as HiZ-GUNDAM to explore the early universe.}},

    abstract = {{Among the most puzzling early discoveries of JWST are ``Little Red Dots'' -- compact red sources that host broad Balmer emission lines and, in many cases, exhibit a ``V shaped'' change in slope in the rest-optical. The physical properties of Little Red Dots currently have order-of-magnitude uncertainties, because models to explain the continuum of these sources differ immensely. Here, we leverage the complete selection of red sources in the RUBIES program, supplemented with public PRISM spectra, to study the origin of this ``V shape''. By fitting a broken power law with a flexible inflection point, we find that a large fraction (20/44, nearly all spatially unresolved) of extremely red H$\alpha$ emitters at $2<z<6$ exhibit a strong change in slope, and that all strong inflections appear associated with the Balmer limit ($0.3645$ $\mu$m). Using a simple model of a reddened AGN with an unobscured scattered light component, we demonstrate that the observed ``V shape'' in Little Red Dots is unlikely to occur at any specific wavelength if the entire continuum is dominated by light from a power law AGN continuum. In contrast, models with an intrinsic feature at the Balmer limit, such as those that are dominated by evolved stellar populations in the rest-UV-to-optical, can produce the observed spectral shapes, provided that a reddened component picks up sufficiently redward of the break. While no model can comfortably explain the full Little Red Dot spectral energy distribution, the common inflection location suggests that it is most likely a single component that consistently dominates the rest-UV-to-optical in Little Red Dots, and that this component is associated with $T\sim10^4$ K hydrogen due to the clear preference for a break at H$\\\\\\_\infty$.}},

We examine SED models in which either galaxy or active galactic nucleus (AGN) emission dominates the rest-frame UV or optical continuum, extracting physical properties to explore each scenario's implications. In the galaxy-only model, we find massive, dusty stellar populations alongside unobscured, low-mass components, hinting at inhomogeneous obscuration. The AGN-only model indicates dusty, luminous AGNs with low hot dust fractions compared to typical quasars. A hybrid AGN and galaxy model suggests low-mass, unobscured galaxies in the UV, with stellar mass estimates spanning $\sim$2 dex across the different models, underscoring the need for caution in interpreting LRD stellar masses. With MIRI photometry, the galaxy-only model produces stellar masses within cosmological limits, but extremely high stellar mass densities are inferred. The hybrid model infers highly overmassive black holes exceeding those in recently reported high-redshift AGNs, hinting at a partial AGN contribution to the rest-optical continuum or widespread super- Eddington accretion. Our findings highlight the extreme conditions required for both AGN or galaxy dominated scenarios in LRDs, supporting a mixed contribution to the red continuum, or novel scenarios to explain the observed emission.}},

The highest levels of X-ray weakness occur in SMBHs accreting at mildly super-Eddington rates (1.4 < f $\\\\\\_{Edd}$ < 4) with zero spin, viewed at angles >30{\textdegree} from the pole. X-ray bolometric corrections in the observed 2{\textendash}10 keV band reach {\ensuremath{\sim}}{}10$^{4}$ at z = 6, {\ensuremath{\sim}}5 times higher than the highest constraint from X-ray stacking. Most SEDs are extraordinarily steep and soft in the X-rays (median photon index {\ensuremath{\Gamma}} = 3.1, mode of {\ensuremath{\Gamma}} = 4.4). SEDs strong in the X-rays have harder spectra with a high-energy bump when viewed near the hot (>{}10$^{8}$ K) and highly relativistic jet, whereas X-ray weak SEDs lack this feature. Viewing an SMBH within 10{\textdegree} of its pole, where beaming enhances the X-ray emission, has a {\ensuremath{\sim}}1.5\\\\\\\% probability, matching the LRD X-ray detection rate. Next-generation observatories like AXIS will detect X-ray-weak LRDs at z {\ensuremath{\sim}} 6 from any viewing angle. Although many SMBHs in the LRDs are already estimated to accrete at super-Eddington rates, our model explains 50\\\\\\\% of their population by requiring that their masses are overestimated by a mere factor of {\ensuremath{\sim}}3. In summary, we suggest that LRDs host slowly spinning SMBHs accreting at mildly super-Eddington rates, with large covering factors and broad emission lines enhanced by strong winds, providing a self-consistent explanation for their X-ray weakness and complementing other models.}},

    abstract = {{The James Webb Space Telescope has uncovered a puzzling population of UV-faint broad-line active galactic nuclei (AGN), nicknamed ``Little Red Dots'' (LRD) owing to their compact morphology and red rest-frame optical colours. Interpreted as dust attenuated AGN, their inferred intrinsic luminosities and supermassive black hole (SMBH) masses rival those of UV-luminous quasars, although they are $>100$ times more abundant. If LRDs and quasars are members of the same underlying population, they should inhabit comparable mass dark matter halos, traced by similar overdensities of galaxies. Otherwise, they represent distinct populations with different physical properties and formation histories. Characterizing LRD environments thus provides a critical test of their nature. Here, we report the discovery of a LRD at $z=7.3$, attenuated by moderate amounts of dust, $A\\\\\\_V = {3.26}\,\rm{mag}$, with an intrinsic bolometric luminosity of $10^{46.7}\,\rm{erg}\,\rm{s}^{-1}$ and a SMBH mass of $7\times10^8\,\rm{M}\\\\\\_\odot$. Most notably, this object is embedded in an overdensity of eight nearby galaxies, allowing us to calculate the first spectroscopic estimate of the clustering of galaxies around LRDs. We find a LRD-galaxy cross-correlation length of $r\\\\\\_0\!=\!9\pm2\,\rm{h}^{-1}\,\rm{cMpc}$, comparable to that of $z\!\sim\!6$ UV-luminous quasars. The resulting estimate of their minimum dark matter halo mass of $\log\\\\\\_{10}(M\\\\\\_{\rm{halo, min}}/\rm{M}\\\\\\_{\odot})= 12.3\\\\\\_{-0.8}^{+0.7}$ indicates that nearly all halos above this mass must host actively accreting SMBHs at $z\approx7$, in strong contrast with the far smaller duty cycle of luminous quasars ($<1\\\\\\\%$). Our results, taken at face value, motivate a picture in which LRDs are the obscured counterparts of UV- luminous quasars, which provides a natural explanation for the short UV-luminous lifetimes inferred from both quasar clustering and quasar proximity zones.}},

Here we present a comprehensive study of the variability of 314 LRDs with multi-epoch JWST observations in five deep fields: UDS, GOODS-S, GOODS-N, Abell 2744, and COSMOS. Our analyses use all publicly available JWST NIRCam imaging data in these fields, together with multi-epoch JWST MIRI images available. We measure the significance (signal-to-noise ratio or ${\rm SNR}\\\\\\_{\rm var}$) of the variabilities for all LRDs and statistically evaluate their variabilities using the ${\rm SNR}\\\\\\_{\rm var}$ distributions. We pay particular attention to the systematic offsets of photometric zero points among different epochs that seem to commonly exist. The derived ${\rm SNR}\\\\\\_{\rm var}$ distributions of the LRDs, including those with broad H$α$/H$β$ emission lines, follow the standard Gaussian distribution, and are generally consistent with those of the comparison samples of objects detected in the same images. This finding suggests that the LRD population on average does not show strong variability, which can be explained by super-Eddington accretion of the black holes in AGNs. Alternatively, many of them may be dominated by galaxies. We also find eight strongly variable LRD candidates with variability amplitudes of 0.24 -- 0.82 mag. The rest-frame optical SEDs of these variable LRDs should have significant AGN contribution. Future JWST observations will provide more variability information of LRDs.}},

The discovery highlights the presence of dust-reddened AGN populations, referred to as ``little red dots (LRDs),'' more abundant than X-ray-selected AGNs, which are less influenced by obscuration. This finding indicates that the cosmic growth rate of BHs within this population does not decrease but rather increases at higher redshifts beyond z {\ensuremath{\sim}} 6. The BH accretion rate density deduced from their luminosity function is remarkably higher than that from other AGN surveys in X-ray and infrared bands. To align the cumulative mass density accreted to BHs with the observed BH mass density at z ≃ 4{\textendash}5, as derived from the integration of the BH mass function, the radiative efficiency must be doubled from the canonical 10\\\\\\\% value, achieving significance beyond the >3{\ensuremath{\sigma}} confidence level. This suggests the presence of rapid spins with 96\\\\\\\% of the maximum limit among these BHs under the thin-disk approximation, maintained by prolonged mass accretion instead of chaotic accretion with randomly oriented inflows. Moreover, we derive an upper bound for the stellar mass of galaxies hosting these LRDs, ensuring consistency with galaxy formation in the standard cosmological model, where the host stellar mass is limited by the available baryonic reservoir. Our analysis gives a lower bound for the BH- to-galaxy mass ratio that exceeds the typical value known in the nearby universe and aligns with that for JWST-detected unobscured AGNs. Accordingly, we propose a hypothesis that the dense, dust-rich environments within LRDs facilitate the emergence of rapidly spinning and overmassive BH populations during the epoch of reionization. This scenario predicts a potential association between relativistic jets and other high- energy phenomena with overmassive BHs in the early universe.}},

We analyze 434 known LRDs from the 0.54 ${\rm deg}^2$ COSMOS-Web survey and test the hypothesis that they originated from SMPBHs assuming sub-Eddington accretion.

Many of these systems, now known as ``little red dots'' (LRDs), are compact and have unique colors that are very red in the optical/near-infrared and blue in the ultraviolet. The relative contribution of galaxy starlight and AGN to these systems remains uncertain, especially for the galaxies with unusual blue+red spectral energy distributions. In this work, we use Balmer decrements to measure the independent dust attenuation of the broad and narrow emission-line components of a sample of 29 broad-line AGN identified from three public JWST spectroscopy surveys: CEERS, JADES, and RUBIES. Stacking the narrow components from the spectra of 25 sources with broad H$\rm{\alpha}$ and no broad H$\rm{\beta}$ results in a median narrow H$\rm{\alpha}$/H$\rm{\beta}$ = $2.47^{+0.05}\\\\\\_{-0.05}$ (consistent with $A\\\\\\_{v} = 0$) and broad H$\rm{\alpha}$/H$\rm{\beta}$ $> 8.85$ ($A\\\\\\_{v} > 3.63$). The narrow and broad Balmer decrements imply little-to-no attenuation of the narrow emission lines, which are consistent with being powered by star formation and located on larger physical scales. Meanwhile, the lower limit in broad H$\rm{\alpha}$/H$\rm{\beta}$ decrement, with broad H$\rm{\beta}$ undetected in the stacked spectrum of 25 broad-H$\rm{\alpha}$ AGN, implies significant dust attenuation of the broad-line emitting region that is presumably associated with the central AGN. Our results indicate that these systems, on average, are consistent with heavily dust-attenuated AGN powering the red parts of their SED while their blue UV emission is powered by unattenuated star formation in the host galaxy.}},

We present new grid-based hydrodynamics simulations, performed with the binary on the grid and a locally isothermal equation of state, in which the binary is seen to functionally ``stop accreting`` if the orbital Mach number in the disk exceeds a threshold value of about 40. Above this threshold, the disk continues to extract angular momentum from the binary orbit, but it delivers very little mass to the black holes, and instead piles up mass in a ring surrounding the binary. This ring will eventually become viscously relaxed and deliver mass to the binary at the large-scale inflow rate. However we show that the timescale for such relaxation can far exceed the implied binary lifetime. We demonstrate that the ability of a binary-disk system to equilibrate is dependent on the efficiency at which accretion streams deposit mass onto the binary; which in turn is highly sensitive to the thermodynamic conditions of the inner disk. If disks around massive black hole binaries do operate in such non-accreting regimes, it suggests these systems may be dimmer than their single black hole counterparts, but could exhibit dramatic re-brightening after the black holes in-spiral and merge. This dimming occurs at high photon energies, corresponding to the effective truncation of the circumbinary disk. As a result, such system may be underluminous in UV bands and missing X-ray emission entirely, potentially resembling the spectra of `Little Red Dots'' recently identified in JWST observations.}},

The spectroscopically selected LRDs exhibit broad H{\ensuremath{\alpha}} emission lines, which likely indicate that type I active galactic nuclei (AGNs) are harbored in the galaxies' dust-reddened cores. However, other mechanisms, like strong outflowing winds, could also produce broad H{\ensuremath{\alpha}} emission lines, and thus, the nature of LRDs is still under debate. We test the AGN hypothesis for LRDs by stacking the archival Chandra observations of 34 spectroscopically selected LRDs. We obtain tentative detections in the soft (0.5{\textendash}2 keV) and hard (2{\textendash}8 keV) X-ray bands with 2.9{\ensuremath{\sigma}} and 3.2{\ensuremath{\sigma}} significance, and with 4.1{\ensuremath{\sigma}} significance when combining the two bands. Nevertheless, we find that the soft (hard) band 3{\ensuremath{\sigma}} upper limit is {\ensuremath{\sim}}1 dex ({\ensuremath{\sim}}0.3 dex) lower than the expected level from the L $\\\\\\_{X}${\textendash}L $\\\\\\_{H{\ensuremath{\alpha}} }$ relation for typical type I AGNs. Our results indicate that AGN activity is indeed likely present in LRDs though these objects have significantly different properties compared to previously identified type I AGNs, i.e., LRDs may have intrinsically weak X-ray emissions. We find it difficult to explain the low L $\\\\\\_{X}$/L $\\\\\\_{H{\ensuremath{\alpha}} }$ ratios observed in LRDs solely by absorption. It is also unlikely that fast outflows have major contributions to the broad H{\ensuremath{\alpha}} lines.

The rest-frame UV cannot be explained by a dusty quasar component alone and requires an additional blue component consistent with either a star-forming host galaxy or scattered AGN light. We detect broad high-ionization emission lines in the rest-UV, supporting the scattered light interpretation for the UV excess. The scattering fraction represents just 0.05 per cent of the total luminosity of ULASJ2315+0143 . Analysis of the mid- infrared SED suggests an absence of hot dust on torus-scales similar to what is observed for LRDs. The obscuring medium is therefore likely on galaxy scales. We detect narrow, blueshifted associated absorption-line systems in C IV, N V, Si IV, and Si III.

Given their extreme red colouring in the observed frame these galaxies have been dubbed Little Red Dots (LRDs). The aim of this project was to identify LRDs using photometric data from previously uninvestigated JWST datasets and to estimate their AGN fractions by fitting the spectral energy distribution of each galaxy against well calibrated templates using CIGALE. We identified a list of potential LRDs using a single colour cut of F444W-F277W $>$1.5 mag and by applying a morphological analysis. We used EAZY to estimate the (photometric) redshift and CIGALE to estimate the AGN fraction of each LRD. Overall, we identified 14 LRDs, applying accurate SED fits to 11 of them. We found that 7 of them had a high AGN fraction (with the AGN component generating more than 50\textbackslash\\\\\\\% of the observed flux), a further two LRDs had AGN contribution in excess of approximately 40\textbackslash\\\\\\\%. In total nine LRDs (our of 14) are likely to have a supermassive black hole in their centre. Interestingly, the three LRDs which could not be well fit by CIGALE displayed extremely high photometric redshifts ($z\\\\\\_{phot} rsim 11$) and require further analysis (and may also host a supermassive black hole in their centre).}},

We select these sources directly from JWST/NIRSpec G395M/F290LP spectra. We use a multi-step pre- selection and a Bayesian fitting procedure to ensure a high- quality sample of sources with broad Balmer lines and narrow forbidden lines. We compute rest-frame ultraviolet and optical spectral slopes for these objects, and determine that 10 BLAGN in our sample are also little red dots (LRDs). These LRD BLAGN, when examined in aggregate, show broader H-alpha line profiles and a higher fraction of broad-to-narrow component H-alpha emission than non-LRD BLAGN. Moreover, we find that \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde66\\\\\\\% of these objects are intrinsically reddened (beta (optical)>0), independent of the contributions of emission lines to the broadband photometry. We construct the black hole (BH) mass function at 3.5<z<6 after computing robust observational and line detection completeness corrections. This BH mass function shows broad agreement with both recent JWST/NIRSpec and JWST/NIRCam WFSS based BH mass functions, though we extend these earlier results to log(M(BH)/M(sun)) < 7. The derived BH mass function is consistent with a variety of theoretical models, indicating that the observed abundance of black holes in the early universe is not discrepant with physically-motivated predictions. The BH mass function shape resembles a largely featureless power-law, suggesting that any signature from black-hole seeding has been lost by redshift z\raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde5-6. Finally, we compute the BLAGN UV luminosity function and find good agreement with JWST-detected BLAGN samples from recent works, finding that BLAGN hosts constitute <10\\\\\\\% of the total observed UV luminosity at all but the brightest luminosities.}},

This population includes a subset known as 'Little Red Dots', characterized by their compact morphology and extremely red rest-frame optical colors. If all of these broad H$\alpha$ emitters were attributed to type $1-1.9$ Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs), it would imply a significantly higher number density of low-luminosity AGNs than extrapolated from that of more luminous AGNs. Here, we have examined the rest-frame ultraviolet (UV)-optical flux variability of five JWST broad H$\alpha$ emitters using multi-epoch, multi-band JWST/NIRCam imaging data. The rest-frame temporal sampling interval of the NIRCam data ($\sim 400-500$\raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitildedays$/(1+z)$) is comparable to typical variability timescales of AGNs with black hole (BH) masses of $M\\\\\\_{\text{BH}} \sim 10^{7}\textasciitilde M\\\\\\_{\odot}$; thus, the flux variations should be detectable if AGNs were present. However, no measurable flux variation over the rest-frame wavelength range of $\lambda\\\\\\_{\text{rest}} \sim 1,500-9,000${\r{A}} has been detected, placing stringent upper limits on the variability amplitudes. This result, combined with the X-ray faintness confirmed by the ultra-deep \{\textbackslashit Chandra\} data, indicates that, under the AGN scenario, we need to postulate peculiar Compton-thick broad-line AGNs with either ($a$) an intrinsically non-variable AGN disk continuum, ($b$) a host galaxy-dominated continuum, or ($c$) scattering-dominated AGN emission. Alternatively, ($d$) they could be non-AGNs where the broad-line emission originates from unusually fast and dense/low-metallicity star-formation-driven outflows or inelastic Raman scattering of stellar UV continua by neutral hydrogen atoms.}},

A substellar Galactic nature is deemed unlikely, given that the Cerberus's relatively flat NIRCam-to-NIRCam and very red NIRCam-to-MIRI flux ratios are not consistent with any brown dwarf model.

Due to the high cloud density, stellar feedback is inefficient, and most of the gas turns into stars in star clusters that rapidly merge hierarchically, creating deep potential wells. Relatively low- mass BH seeds at random positions can be ``captured'' by merging subclusters and migrate to the center in {\ensuremath{\sim}}1 freefall time (vastly faster than dynamical friction). This also efficiently produces a paired BH binary with {\ensuremath{\sim}}0.1 pc separation. The centrally concentrated stellar density profile (akin to a ``protobulge'') allows the cluster as a whole to capture and retain gas and build up a large (parsec-scale) circumbinary accretion disk with gas coherently funneled to the central BH (even when the BH radius of influence is small). The disk is ``hypermagnetized'' and ``flux-frozen'': dominated by a toroidal magnetic field with plasma {\ensuremath{\beta}} {\ensuremath{\sim}} 10$^{‑3}$, with the fields amplified by flux-freezing. This drives hyper- Eddington inflow rates {\ensuremath{\gtrsim}}1 M $\\\\\\_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$ yr$^{‑1}$, which also drive the two BHs to nearly equal masses. The late-stage system appears remarkably similar to recently observed high-redshift ``little red dots.'' This scenario can provide an explanation for rapid SMBH formation, growth, and mergers in high-redshift galaxies.}},

    abstract = {{The discovery of Little Red Dots (LRDs){\textemdash}a population of compact, high-redshift, dust-reddened galaxies{\textemdash}is one of the most surprising results from JWST. However, the nature of LRDs is still debated: does the near-infrared emission originate from accreting supermassive black holes (SMBHs), or intense star formation? In this work, we utilize ultra-deep Chandra observations and study LRDs residing behind the lensing galaxy cluster, A2744. We probe the X-ray emission from individual galaxies but find that they remain undetected and provide SMBH mass upper limits of {\ensuremath{\lesssim}}(1.5{\textendash}16) {\texttimes} {}10$^{6}$ M $\\\\\\_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$ assuming Eddington limited accretion. To increase the signal-to-noise ratios, we conduct a stacking analysis of the full sample with a total lensed exposure time of {\ensuremath{\approx}}87 Ms. We also bin the galaxies based on their stellar mass, lensing magnification, and detected broad-line H{\ensuremath{\alpha}} emission. For the LRDs exhibiting broad-line H{\ensuremath{\alpha}} emission, there is a hint of a stacked signal ({\ensuremath{\sim}}2.6{\ensuremath{\sigma}}), corresponding to an SMBH mass of {\ensuremath{\sim}}3.2 {\texttimes} {}10$^{6}$ M $\\\\\\_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$. Assuming unobscured, Eddington- limited accretion, this black hole (BH) mass is at least 1.5 orders of magnitude lower than that inferred from virial mass estimates using JWST spectra. Given galaxy-dominated stellar mass estimates, our results imply that LRDs do not host overmassive SMBHs and/or accrete at a few percent of their Eddington limit. However, alternative stellar mass estimates may still support that LRDs host overmassive BHs. The significant discrepancy between the JWST and Chandra data hints that the scaling relations used to infer the SMBH mass from the H{\ensuremath{\alpha}} line and virial relations may not be applicable for high-redshift LRDs.}},

Such steep rise in the near-infrared, completely missed without MIRI imaging, is poorly reproduced by models including only stellar populations and hints towards the presence of an Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN). According to the shape of its overall SED, Virgil belongs to the recently discovered population of Little Red Dots (LRDs) but displays an extended rest-frame UV-optical wavelengths morphology following a 2D-S{\'e}rsic profile with average index $n = 0.93^{+0.85}\\\\\\_{-0.31}$ and $r\\\\\\_e = 0.49^{+0.05}\\\\\\_{-0.11}$ pkpc.

This allows us to measure their contribution to the cosmic census at z > 3, below the typical detection limits of ALMA (L $\\\\\\_{IR}$ < 10$^{12 }$ L $\\\\\\_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$). We find that these sources, which are overwhelmingly missed by HST and ALMA, could effectively double the obscured fraction of the star formation rate density at 4 < z < 6 compared to some estimates, showing that prior to JWST, the obscured contribution from fainter sources could be underestimated. Finally, we identify five sources with evidence for Balmer breaks and high stellar masses at 5.5 < z < 7.7.

The Little Red Dots (LRDs), detected by several surveys at $z > 4$, present a significant interpretational challenge, as their Spectral Energy Distributions (SED) can mimic both AGN and stellar population templates. This study analyzes 19 LRDs from the JADES survey, utilizing NIRCam and MIRI photometry. By performing SED fitting across a vast parameter space, we explore a broad range of AGN fractions, defined as the ratio of the monochromatic luminosities (AGN, galaxy, and dust) over a specified wavelength range, 0.4 - 0.7 $μm$ rest-frame. We find that 17 of the 19 LRDs investigated are consistent with having significant AGN contributions, with best-fitting AGN fractions ranging between 20\\\\\\\% and 70\\\\\\\%, while one galaxy shows a low AGN contribution (2\\\\\\\%) and another appears to be purely star-forming. Moreover, assuming these LRDs do indeed host AGN, we can place limits on their black hole masses using the inferred AGN bolometric luminosities and adopting the Eddington limit. We find that, independent of the specific AGN fraction adopted, the LRDs' black holes are significantly overmassive relative to their host galaxies (by $\sim 1$ dex, and up to $\sim 4$ dex in the most extreme cases) compared to the local $M\\\\\\_{\bullet} - M\\\\\\_{\star}$ relation. The presence of overmassive black holes in the high-$z$ Universe may provide the strongest evidence yet of heavy black hole seeding occurring during the cosmic dark ages.}},

We present a sample of 434 ``little red dots'' (LRDs), selected from the 0.54 deg$^2$ COSMOS-Web survey. We fit galaxy and AGN SED models to derive redshifts and physical properties; the sample spans $z\sim5$-$9$ after removing brown dwarf contaminants. We consider two extreme physical scenarios: either LRDs are all AGN, and their continuum emission is dominated by the accretion disk, or they are all compact star-forming galaxies, and their continuum is dominated by stars. If LRDs are AGN-dominated, our sample exhibits bolometric luminosities $\sim10^{45-47}$ erg\textbackslash,s$^{-1}$, spanning the gap between JWST AGN in the literature and bright, rare quasars. We derive a bolometric luminosity function (LF) $\sim100$ times the (UV-selected) quasar LF, implying a non-evolving black hole accretion density of $\sim10^{-4}$ M$\\\\\\_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-3}$ from $z\sim2$-$9$. By contrast, if LRDs are dominated by star formation, we derive stellar masses $\sim10^{8.5-10}\,M\\\\\\_\odot$. MIRI/F770W is key to deriving accurate stellar masses; without it, we derive a mass function inconsistent with $\Lambda$CDM. The median stellar mass profile is broadly consistent with the maximal stellar mass surface densities seen in the nearby universe, though the most massive $\sim50$\textbackslash\\\\\\\% of objects exceed this limit, requiring substantial AGN contribution to the continuum. Nevertheless, stacking all available X-ray, mid-IR, far-IR/sub-mm, and radio data yields non-detections.

    abstract = {{We present a sample of 341 ``little red dots'' (LRDs) spanning the redshift range $z\sim2-11$ using data from the CEERS, PRIMER, JADES, UNCOVER and NGDEEP surveys. Unlike past use of color indices to identify LRDs, we employ continuum slope fitting using shifting bandpasses to sample the same rest-frame emission blueward and redward of the Balmer break. This enables the detection of LRDs over a wider redshift range and with less contamination from galaxies with strong breaks that otherwise lack a rising red continuum. The redshift distribution of our sample increases at $z<8$ and then undergoes a rapid decline at $z\sim4.5$, which may tie the emergence of these sources to the inside-out growth that galaxies experience during this epoch. We find that LRDs are $\sim1$ dex more numerous than X-ray and UV selected AGN at z\raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde5-7. Within our sample, we have identified the first two X-ray detected LRDs. An X-ray spectral analysis confirms that these AGN are moderately obscured with $\log\,(N\\\\\\_{\rm H}/{\rm cm}^{2}$) of $23.3^{+0.4}\\\\\\_{-1.3}$ and $22.72^{+0.13}\\\\\\_{-0.16}$. Our analysis reveals that reddened AGN emission dominates their rest-optical light, while the rest-UV originates from their host galaxies. We also present NIRSpec observations from the RUBIES survey of 17 LRDs that show broad emission lines consistent with AGN activity. The confirmed AGN fraction of our sample is 71\textbackslash\\\\\\\% for sources with F444W<26.5. In addition, we find three LRDs with blue-shifted Balmer absorption features in their spectra, suggesting an outflow of high-density, low- ionization gas from near the central engine of these faint, red AGN.}},

These LAEs with high Ly{\ensuremath{\alpha}} luminosity of L(Ly{\ensuremath{\alpha}}) {\ensuremath{\sim}}10$^{42.4}${\textendash}10$^{43.4}$ erg s$^{‑1}$ have been covered by the (ongoing) COSMOS-Web survey over 0.28 deg$^{2}$ in four NIRCam bands (F115W, F150W, F277W, and F444W). With JWST/NIRCam imaging, we determine the UV continua with M $\\\\\\_{UV}$ ranging from ‑20.5 to ‑18.5 mag. The UV slopes have a median value of {\ensuremath{\beta}} {\ensuremath{\approx}} ‑2.35, and the steepest slopes can reach {\ensuremath{\beta}} < ‑3. Under the excellent spatial resolution of JWST, we identify three objects in the sample as potential merging/interacting systems. The 14 LAEs (and their components) are compact in morphology, residing substantially below the mass{\textendash}size relation of high-z galaxies. We further investigate their physical properties, including the stellar mass (M $\\\\\\_{*}$) and star formation rates (SFRs). Most of the LAEs lie on the SFR{\textendash}M $\\\\\\_{*}$ main-sequence relation, while two of them, featured as ``little red dots,'' likely host active galactic nuclei (AGNs), implying a {\ensuremath{\sim}}10\\\\\\\% AGN fraction. Moreover, we reveal that a new correlation may exist between Ly{\ensuremath{\alpha}} equivalent width and the offset between Ly{\ensuremath{\alpha}} and UV emission ({\ensuremath{\Delta}}d $\\\\\\_{Ly{\ensuremath{\alpha}} }$), with a median {\ensuremath{\Delta}}d $\\\\\\_{Ly{\ensuremath{\alpha}} }$ {\ensuremath{\sim}} 1 kpc. This could be explained by the Ly{\ensuremath{\alpha}} radiative transfer process in both the interstellar medium and circumgalactic medium. The results usher in a new era of detailed analysis on high-z LAEs with the JWST capability.}},

    abstract = {{The JWST discovery of ``little red dots'' (LRDs) is reshaping our picture of the early Universe, yet the physical mechanisms driving their compact size and UV-optical colors remain elusive. Here we report an unusually bright LRD ($z=3.1$) observed as part of the RUBIES program. This LRD exhibits broad emission lines (FWHM $\sim4000$km/s), a blue UV continuum, a clear Balmer break and a red continuum sampled out to rest 4 $\mu$m with MIRI. We develop a new joint galaxy and AGN model within the Prospector Bayesian inference framework and perform spectrophotometric modeling using NIRCam, MIRI, and NIRSpec/Prism observations. Our fiducial model reveals a $M\\\\\\_*\sim 10^9M\\\\\\_\odot$ galaxy alongside a dust-reddened AGN driving the optical emission. Explaining the rest-frame optical color as a reddened AGN requires $A\\\\\\_{\rm v}rsim3$, suggesting that a great majority of the accretion disk energy is re- radiated as dust emission. Yet despite clear AGN signatures, we find a surprising lack of hot torus emission, which implies that either the dust emission in this object must be cold, or the red continuum must instead be driven by a massive, evolved stellar population of the host galaxy -- seemingly inconsistent with the high EW broad lines (H$\alpha$ EW $\sim800${\r{A}}). The widths and luminosities of Pa$\beta$, Pa$\delta$, Pa$\gamma$, and H$\alpha$ imply a modest black hole mass of $M\\\\\\_{\rm BH}\sim10^8M\\\\\\_\odot$. Additionally, we identify a narrow blue- shifted HeI absorption in G395M spectra, signaling an ionized outflow with kinetic energy up to $\sim1$\textbackslash\\\\\\\% the luminosity of the AGN. The low redshift of RUBIES-BLAGN-1 combined with the depth and richness of the JWST imaging and spectroscopic observations provide a unique opportunity to build a physical model for these so-far mysterious LRDs, which may prove to be a crucial phase in the early formation of massive galaxies and their supermassive black holes.}},

    abstract = {{Characterizing the prevalence and properties of faint active galactic nuclei (AGNs) in the early Universe is key for understanding the formation of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) and determining their role in cosmic reionization. We perform a spectroscopic search for broad H{\ensuremath{\alpha}} emitters at z {\ensuremath{\approx}} 4{\textendash}6 using deep JWST/NIRCam imaging and wide field slitless spectroscopy from the EIGER and FRESCO surveys. We identify 20 H{\ensuremath{\alpha}} lines at z = 4.2{\textendash}5.5 that have broad components with line widths from {\ensuremath{\sim}}1200{\textendash}3700 km s$^{‑1}$, contributing {\ensuremath{\sim}}30\\\\\\\%{\textendash}90\\\\\\\% of the total line flux.

In the UV luminosity range M $\\\\\\_{UV,AGN+host}$ = ‑21 to ‑18, we measure number densities of {\ensuremath{\approx}}10$^{‑5}$ cMpc$^{‑3}$. This is an order of magnitude higher than expected from extrapolating quasar UV luminosity functions (LFs). Yet, such AGN are found in only <1\\\\\\\% of star-forming galaxies at z {\ensuremath{\sim}} 5. The number density discrepancy is much lower when compared to the broad H{\ensuremath{\alpha}} LF. The SMBH mass function agrees with large cosmological simulations. In two objects, we detect complex H{\ensuremath{\alpha}} profiles that we tentatively interpret as caused by absorption signatures from dense gas fueling SMBH growth and outflows. We may be witnessing early AGN feedback that will clear dust-free pathways through which more massive blue quasars are seen. We uncover a strong correlation between reddening and the fraction of total galaxy luminosity arising from faint AGN. This implies that early SMBH growth is highly obscured and that faint AGN are only minor contributors to cosmic reionization.}},

Recently, a NIRCam-selected sample of little red dots over 45 arcmin$^{2}$ has been followed up with deep NIRSpec multiobject prism spectroscopy through the UNCOVER program. By investigating the acquired spectra, we identify 3 of the 14 followed-up objects as T/Y dwarfs with temperatures between 650 and 1300 K and distances between 0.8 and 4.8 kpc. At ${4.8}\\\\\\_{-0.1}^{+0.6}$ kpc, A2744-BD1 is the most distant brown dwarf discovered to date. We identify the remaining 11 objects as extragalactic sources at z $\\\\\\_{spec}$ {\ensuremath{\gtrsim}} 5. Given that three of these sources are strongly lensed images of the same AGN (A2744-QSO1), we derive a brown dwarf contamination fraction of 25\\\\\\\% in this NIRCam selection of little red dots. We find that in the near-infrared filters, brown dwarfs appear much bluer than the highly reddened AGN, providing an avenue for distinguishing the two and compiling cleaner samples of photometrically selected highly reddened AGN.}},
