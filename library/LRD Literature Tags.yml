# List of tags and descriptions for classifying Little Red Dot (LRD) research papers.
# Intended for use with an AI model to automatically tag papers based on their abstracts.
tags:
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Research Methodology: How the study interacts with the LRD topic
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  - tag: case study
    description: Provides an in-depth analysis of one or a few specific LRD sources (e.g., spectral decomposition of a single object).
  - tag: catalog
    description: Presents a list or table of LRD sources, candidates, or related objects with measured/derived properties from a survey.
  - tag: simulation
    description: Uses computational models (hydrodynamical, cosmological, radiative transfer) to predict or interpret LRD properties.
  - tag: theory
    description: Primarily discusses theoretical models, physical mechanisms (e.g., seeding mechanisms, accretion modes), or interpretations of LRD phenomena.
  - tag: review
    description: Summarizes the current state of LRD research, comparing results across multiple surveys and methodologies.

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Hypothesized Nature: What the paper argues the LRD actually is
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  - tag: agn-dominated
    description: Argues that the primary power source and spectral features are driven by an Active Galactic Nucleus (Type 1 or obscured).
  - tag: non-agn
    description: Discusses or proposes scenarios where AGN activity is sub-dominant or absent (e.g., pure stellar models).
  - tag: starburst
    description: Investigates intense, compact star formation activity as a primary or contributing factor to LRD properties.
  - tag: composite
    description: Proposes a hybrid model where both AGN activity and star formation contribute significantly to the observed properties.
  - tag: super-eddington
    description: Specifically investigates super-Eddington accretion regimes to explain the high luminosity and lack of X-rays.
  - tag: heavy seed
    description: Links LRDs to "Heavy Seed" black holes, Direct Collapse Black Holes (DCBH), or over-massive black holes relative to host galaxies.
  - tag: exotic physics
    description: Explores non-standard explanations such as Supermassive Stars, Quasi-stars, Dark Stars, or Dark Matter interactions.
  - tag: dust-reddened
    description: Attributes the red color primarily to dust extinction (e.g., dusty torus or host galaxy dust) rather than intrinsic emission color.

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Key Observations: What data/wavelengths are leveraged
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  - tag: variability
    description: Studies time-domain changes in brightness or spectral features (or lack thereof) to distinguish between AGN and stellar origins.
  - tag: x-ray
    description: Discusses observations in the X-ray spectrum (e.g., Chandra), focusing on detections or stacking upper limits.
  - tag: radio
    description: Discusses observations in the radio spectrum (e.g., VLA, LOFAR) to constrain jet activity or star formation rates.
  - tag: alma
    description: Utilizes sub-millimeter/millimeter observations (e.g., ALMA) to constrain dust mass, temperature, and gas content.
  - tag: sed
    description: Focuses on the Spectral Energy Distribution (e.g., the characteristic 'V-shape', UV-turnover, or Balmer break modeling).
  - tag: spectroscopy
    description: Analyzes spectra to identify lines (H-alpha, H-beta), measure line widths (FWHM), or detect outflows.
  - tag: photometry
    description: Derives properties from imaging/colors (e.g., selecting 'V-shaped' candidates via filter cuts).
  - tag: jwst
    description: Utilizes observational data primarily from JWST (NIRCam, NIRSpec, MIRI).
  - tag: non-jwst
    description: Utilizes data from HST, Spitzer, or ground-based telescopes, often for pre-selection or archival comparison.
  - tag: multi-wavelength
    description: Combines data from significantly different spectral regions (e.g., Optical/IR + X-ray/Radio/ALMA) for a panchromatic view.
  - tag: early universe
    description: Pertains to cosmic epochs at high redshift (z > 4), the peak era of the LRD population.
  - tag: local counterpart
    description: Discusses potential analogs to high-z LRDs found in the local or lower-redshift universe (z < 1), such as Green Peas or Blueberries.

  - tag: black hole mass
    description: Discusses estimation of the central SMBH mass, often using virial scaling relations or exploring the M_BH-M_star relation.
  - tag: abundance
    description: Focuses on the number density, luminosity function, or cosmic evolution of the LRD population.
  - tag: clustering
    description: Analyzes the spatial distribution/environment of LRDs (e.g., halo mass, satellite fraction) to infer their cosmological context.
  - tag: emission lines
    description: Analyzes spectral emission lines (e.g., Broad vs Narrow Balmer lines, [OIII], [NII]), ratios, or BPT diagnostics.
  - tag: absorption features
    description: Specifically investigates absorption lines (e.g., Balmer absorption) indicative of dense gas reservoirs or specific stellar populations.
  - tag: host galaxy
    description: Studies properties of the host galaxy (stellar mass, size, morphology) after decomposing the central point source.
  - tag: kinematics
    description: Examines gas/star motion, velocity dispersion, or outflows derived from line profiles.
  - tag: morphology
    description: Focuses on the compactness (unresolved vs resolved), size (effective radius), or structural decomposition of the source.
  - tag: obscuration
    description: Investigates column densities (N_H), dust attenuation (Av), or gas density responsible for the spectral shape.
  - tag: sample selection
    description: Describes or critiques the specific color cuts, magnitude limits, or biases used to define the LRD sample.
