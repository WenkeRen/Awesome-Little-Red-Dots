Despite the widespread presence of AGN signatures in their rest-optical and -ultraviolet spectra, the vast majority of them is X-ray undetected. The stacked X-ray data of the non- detected sources also results in a non-detection. The upper limit on the X-ray emission for many of these AGN is one or even two orders of magnitude lower than expected from a standard AGN Spectral Energy Distribution (SED). X-ray absorption by clouds with large (Compton-thick) column density and low dust content, such as the broad-line region (BLR) clouds, can explain the X-ray weakness. In this scenario, the BLR covering factor should be much larger than in low-z AGN or luminous quasars; this is supported by the larger equivalent width of the broad component of H<inline-formula><tex-math id=``TM0003'' notation=``LaTeX''>$\alpha$</tex-math></inline-formula> in JWST- selected AGN. We also find that the JWST-discovered AGN lack prominent, fast outflows, suggesting that, in JWST-selected AGN, dense gas lingers in the nuclear region, resulting in large covering factors. We also note that a large fraction of JWST- selected AGN matches the definition of narrow-line Seyfert 1, typically accreting at high rates and characterized by a steep X-ray spectrum - this can further contribute to their observed weakness at high-z. Finally, we discuss that the broad Balmer lines used to identify type 1 AGN cannot be ascribed to very massive stars or supernovae, although we show that some of the faintest broad lines could potentially be associated with superluminous SNe.}},

We describe the observations, data reduction, sample selection, and target allocation. We measured 2375 redshifts (2053 from multiple emission lines); our targets span the range from z = 0.5 up to z = 13, including 404 at z > 5. The data release includes 2D and 1D fully reduced spectra, with slit-loss corrections and background subtraction optimized for point sources. We also provide redshifts and signal-to-noise ratio > 5 emission-line flux catalogs for the prism and grating spectra, and concise guidelines on how to use these data products. Alongside spectroscopy, we are also publishing fully calibrated NIRCam imaging, which enables studying the JADES sample with the combined power of imaging and spectroscopy.

    abstract = {{Within the established framework of structure formation, galaxies start as systems of low stellar mass and gradually grow into far more massive galaxies. The existence of massive galaxies in the first billion years of the Universe, as suggested by recent observations, seems to challenge this model, as such galaxies would require highly efficient conversion of baryons into stars. An even greater challenge in this epoch is the existence of massive galaxies that have already ceased forming stars. However, robust detections of early massive quiescent galaxies have been challenging due to the coarse wavelength sampling of photometric surveys. Here we report the spectroscopic confirmation with the James Webb Space Telescope of the quiescent galaxy RUBIES-EGS-QG-1 at redshift z = 4.90, 1.2 billion years after the Big Bang. Deep stellar absorption features in the spectrum reveal that the stellar mass of the galaxy of {}10$^{11}$ M$\_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$ formed in a short 200 Myr burst of star formation, after which star formation activity dropped rapidly and persistently. According to current galaxy formation models, systems with such rapid stellar mass growth and early quenching are too rare to plausibly occur in the small area probed spectroscopically with JWST. Instead, the discovery of RUBIES-EGS-QG-1 implies that early massive quiescent galaxies can be quenched earlier or exhaust gas available for star formation more efficiently than assumed at present.}},

Several different models have been proposed to explain these findings, ranging from heavy seeds to light seeds experiencing bursts of high accretion rate$^{10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15{\textendash}16}$. Yet, current datasets are unable to differentiate between these various scenarios. Here we report the detection, from the JADES survey, of broad H{\ensuremath{\alpha}} emission in a galaxy at z = 6.68, which traces a black hole with a mass of about 4 {\texttimes} {}10$^{8}$M$\_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$ and accreting at a rate of only 0.02 times the Eddington limit. The black hole to host galaxy stellar mass ratio is about 0.4{\textemdash}that is, about 1,000 times above the local relation{\textemdash}whereas the system is closer to the local relations in terms of dynamical mass and velocity dispersion of the host galaxy. This object is most likely an indication of a much larger population of dormant black holes around the epoch of reionization. Its properties are consistent with scenarios in which short bursts of super-Eddington accretion have resulted in black hole overgrowth and massive gas expulsion from the accretion disk; in between bursts, black holes spend most of their life in a dormant state.}},

This source is also characterized by a mid-IR excess, likely associated with the AGN torus' hot dust. The high bolometric luminosity and moderate redshift of this AGN allow us to explore its properties more in depth relative to other JWST-discovered AGN.

This finding suggests that part of the X-ray weakness is due to high (Compton-thick) X-ray absorption by clouds in the BLR, or in its outer regions. GN-28074 is also extremely radio-weak. The radio weakness can also be explained in terms of absorption, as the inferred density of the BLR clouds makes them attenuate the radio emission through free-free absorption. Alternatively, the nuclear magnetic field may be underdeveloped, resulting both in intrinsically weak radio emission and lack of hot corona, hence intrinsic X-ray weakness.

    abstract = {{Spectroscopy with the James Webb Space Telescope has opened the possibility of identifying moderate-luminosity active galactic nuclei (AGNs) in the early Universe, at and beyond the epoch of re-ionisation, complementing previous surveys of much more luminous (and much rarer) quasars. We present 12 new AGNs at 4 < z < 7 in the JADES survey (in addition to the previously identified AGN in GN-z11 at z = 10.6) revealed through the detection of a broad-line region (BLR) seen in the Balmer emission lines. The depth of JADES, together with the use of three different spectral resolutions, enables us to probe a lower-mass regime relative to previous studies. In a few cases, we find evidence for two broad components of H{\ensuremath{\alpha}}, which suggests that these could be candidate merging black holes (BHs), although a complex BLR geometry cannot be excluded. The inferred BH masses range from 8 {\texttimes} {}10$^{7}$ M$\_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$ down to 4 {\texttimes} {}10$^{5}$ M$\_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$, interestingly probing the regime expected for direct collapse BHs. The inferred AGN bolometric luminosities ({\ensuremath{\sim}}{}10$^{44}$ ‑ {}10$^{45}$ erg/s) imply accretion rates that are < 0.5 times the Eddington rate in most cases. However, small BHs, with M$\_{BH}$ {\ensuremath{\sim}} {}10$^{6}$ M$\_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$, tend to accrete at Eddington or super-Eddington rates. These BHs at z {\ensuremath{\sim}} 4{\textendash}11 are over-massive relative to their host galaxies' stellar masses when compared to the local M$\_{BH}$ ‑ M$\_{star}$ relation, even approaching M$\_{BH}$ {\ensuremath{\sim}} M$\_{star}$, as was expected from heavy BH seeds and/or super-Eddington accretion scenarios. However, we find that these early BHs tend to be more consistent with the local relation between M$\_{BH}$ and velocity dispersion, as well as between M$\_{BH}$ and dynamical mass, suggesting that these are more fundamental and universal relations. On the classical, optical narrow-line excitation-diagnostic diagrams, these AGNs are located in the region that is locally occupied by star- forming galaxies, implying that they would be missed by the standard classification techniques if they did not display broad lines. Their location on the diagram is consistent with what is expected for AGNs hosted in metal-poor galaxies (Z {\ensuremath{\sim}} 0.1 ‑ 0.2 Z$\_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$). The fraction of broad-line AGNs with L$\_{AGN}$ > {}10$^{44}$ erg/s among galaxies in the redshift range of 4 < z < 6 is about 10\%, suggesting that the contribution of AGNs and their hosts to the re-ionisation of the Universe is > 10\%.}},

    abstract = {{The identification of red, apparently massive galaxies at z > 7 in early James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) photometry suggests a strongly accelerated time line compared to standard models of galaxy growth. A major uncertainty in the interpretation is whether the red colors are caused by evolved stellar populations, dust, or other effects such as emission lines or active galactic nuclei (AGNs). Here we show that three of the massive galaxy candidates at z = 6.7{\textendash}8.4 have prominent Balmer breaks in JWST/NIRSpec spectroscopy from the RUBIES program. The Balmer breaks demonstrate unambiguously that stellar emission dominates at {\ensuremath{\lambda}} $\_{rest}$ = 0.4 {\ensuremath{\mu}}m and require formation histories extending hundreds of millions of years into the past in galaxies only 600{\textendash}800 Myr after the big bang. Two of the three galaxies also show broad Balmer lines, with H{\ensuremath{\beta}} FWHM > 2500 km s$^{‑1}$, suggesting that dust-reddened AGNs contribute to, or even dominate, the spectral energy distributions of these galaxies at {\ensuremath{\lambda}} $\_{rest}$ {\ensuremath{\gtrsim}} 0.6 {\ensuremath{\mu}}m. All three galaxies have relatively narrow [O III] lines, seemingly ruling out a high-mass interpretation if the lines arise in dynamically relaxed, inclined disks. Yet the inferred masses also remain highly uncertain. We model the high-quality spectra using Prospector to decompose the continuum into stellar and AGN components and explore limiting cases in stellar/AGN contribution. This produces a wide range of possible stellar masses, spanning M $\_{{\ensuremath{\star}}}$ {\ensuremath{\sim}} {}10$^{9}$‑{}10$^{11}$ M $\_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$. Nevertheless, all fits suggest a very early and rapid formation, most of which follow with a truncation in star formation. Potential origins and evolutionary tracks for these objects are discussed, from the cores of massive galaxies to low-mass galaxies with overmassive black holes. Intriguingly, we find all of these explanations to be incomplete; deeper and redder data are needed to understand the physics of these systems.}},

We report significant progress with JWST toward this goal from the Systematic Mid-infrared Instrument Legacy Extragalactic Survey (SMILES). Based on comprehensive spectral energy distribution (SED) analysis of 3273 MIRI-detected sources, we identify 217 AGN candidates over a survey area of {\ensuremath{\sim}}34 arcmin$^{2}$, including a primary sample of 111 AGNs in normal massive galaxies (M $\_{*}$ > 10$^{9.5}$ M $\_{☉}$) at z {\ensuremath{\sim}} 0{\textendash}4, an extended sample of 86 AGN candidates in low-mass galaxies (M $\_{*}$ < 10$^{9.5}$ M $\_{☉}$), and a high-z sample of 20 AGN candidates at z {\ensuremath{\sim}} 4{\textendash}8.4. Notably, about 80\% of our MIRI-selected AGN candidates are new discoveries despite the extensive pre-JWST AGN searches. Even among the massive galaxies where the previous AGN search is believed to be thorough, 34\% of the MIRI AGN identifications are new, highlighting the impact of obscuration on previous selections. By combining our results with the efforts at other wavelengths, we build the most complete AGN sample to date and examine the relative performance of different selection techniques. We find the obscured AGN fraction increases from L $\_{AGN,bol}$ {\ensuremath{\sim}} {}10$^{10}$ L $\_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$ to {}10$^{11}$ L $\_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$ and then drops toward higher luminosity. Additionally, the obscured AGN fraction gradually increases from z {\ensuremath{\sim}} 0 to z {\ensuremath{\sim}} 4 with most high-z AGNs obscured. We discuss how AGN obscuration, intrinsic SED variations, galaxy contamination, survey depth, and selection techniques complicate the construction of a complete AGN sample.}},

One of the most intriguing examples is an extremely red, point-like object that was found to be triply imaged by the strong lensing cluster Abell 2744 (ref. $^{4}$). Here we present deep JWST/NIRSpec observations of this object, Abell2744-QSO1. The spectroscopy confirms that the three images are of the same object, and that it is a highly reddened (A$\_{V}$ ≃ 3) broad emission line active galactic nucleus at a redshift of z$\_{spec}$ = 7.0451 {\ensuremath{\pm}} 0.0005. From the width of H{\ensuremath{\beta}} (full width at half-maximum = 2,800 {\ensuremath{\pm}} 250 km s$^{{\ensuremath{-}}1}$), we derive a black hole mass of M$\_{BH}$=4$\_{{\ensuremath{-}}1}$$^{+2}${\texttimes}1 {}0$^{7}$M$\_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$ . We infer a very high ratio of black-hole-to-galaxy mass of at least 3\%, an order of magnitude more than that seen in local galaxies$^{5}$ and possibly as high as 100\%. The lack of strong metal lines in the spectrum together with the high bolometric luminosity (L$\_{bol}$ = (1.1 {\ensuremath{\pm}} 0.3) {\texttimes} {}10$^{45}$ erg s$^{{\ensuremath{-}}1}$) indicate that we are seeing the black hole in a phase of rapid growth, accreting at 30\% of the Eddington limit. The rapid growth and high black-hole-to-galaxy mass ratio of Abell2744-QSO1 suggest that it may represent the missing link between black hole seeds$^{6}$ and one of the first luminous quasars$^{7}$.}},

    abstract = {{JWST has detected many overmassive galactic systems at z > 4, where the mass of the black hole, M $\_{{\textbullet}}$, is 10{\textendash}100 times larger than expected from local relations, given the host's stellar mass, M $\_{{\ensuremath{\star}}}$. This paper presents a model to describe these overmassive systems in the high-z Universe. We suggest that the black hole mass is the main driver of high-z star formation quenching. Supermassive black holes globally impact their high-z galaxies because their hosts are physically small, and the black holes have duty cycles close to unity at z > 4. In this regime, we assume that black hole mass growth is regulated by the quasar's output, while stellar mass growth is quenched by it and uncorrelated to the global properties of the host halo. We find that the ratio M $\_{{\textbullet}}$/M $\_{{\ensuremath{\star}}}$ controls the average star formation efficiency: if M $\_{{\textbullet}}$/M $\_{{\ensuremath{\star}}}$ > 8 {\texttimes} {}10$^{18}$(n{\ensuremath{\Lambda}}/ f $\_{Edd}$)[({\ensuremath{\Omega}}$\_{ b }$ M $\_{ h }$)/({\ensuremath{\Omega}}$\_{ m }$ M $\_{{\ensuremath{\star}}}$) ‑ 1], then the galaxy is unable to form stars efficiently. Once this ratio exceeds the threshold, a runaway process brings the originally overmassive system toward the local M $\_{{\textbullet}}${\textendash}M $\_{{\ensuremath{\star}}}$ relation. Furthermore, the M $\_{{\textbullet}}${\textendash}M $\_{{\ensuremath{\star}}}$ relation evolves with redshift as {\ensuremath{\propto}}(1 + z)$^{5/2}$. At z {\ensuremath{\sim}} 5, we find an overmassive factor of {\ensuremath{\sim}}55, in excellent agreement with current JWST data and the high-z relation inferred from those. Extending the black hole horizon farther in redshift and lower in mass will test this model and improve our understanding of the early coevolution of black holes and galaxies.}},

We find 37 EROs in the Cosmic Evolution Early Release Science Survey (CEERS) field with F444W < 28 mag and photometric redshifts between 5 < z < 7, with median $z={6.9}\_{-1.6}^{+1.0}$ . Surprisingly, despite their red long-wavelength colors, these EROs have blue short- wavelength colors (F150W ‑ F200W {\ensuremath{\sim}} 0 mag) indicative of bimodal spectral energy distributions (SEDs) with a red, steep slope in the rest-frame optical, and a blue, flat slope in the rest-frame UV. Moreover, all these EROs are unresolved, point-like sources in all NIRCam bands. We analyze the SEDs of eight of them with MIRI and NIRSpec observations using stellar population models and active galactic nucleus (AGN) templates. We find that dusty galaxies or obscured AGNs provide similarly good SED fits but different stellar properties: massive and dusty, $\mathrm{log}{M}\_{\star }/{M}\_{\odot }$ {\ensuremath{\sim}} 10 and A $\_{ V }$ {\ensuremath{\gtrsim}} 3 mag, or low mass and obscured, $\mathrm{log}{M}\_{\star }/{M}\_{\odot }$ {\ensuremath{\sim}} 7.5 and A $\_{ V }$ {\ensuremath{\sim}} 0 mag, hosting an obscured quasi-stellar object (QSO). SED modeling does not favor either scenario, but their unresolved sizes are more suggestive of AGNs. If any EROs are confirmed to have $\mathrm{log}{M}\_{\star }/{M}\_{\odot }$ {\ensuremath{\gtrsim}} 10.5, it would increase the pre-JWST number density at z > 7 by up to a factor {\ensuremath{\sim}}60. Similarly, if they are QSOs with luminosities in the L $\_{bol}$ > 10$^{45{\textendash}46}$ erg s$^{‑1}$ range, their number would exceed that of bright blue QSOs by more than three orders of magnitude. Additional photometry at mid-infrared wavelengths will reveal the true nature of the red continuum emission in these EROs and will place this puzzling population in the right context of galaxy evolution.}},

Remarkably, among all z $\_{phot}$ > 5 galaxies with F277W {\textendash} F444W > 1 in UNCOVER at least 33\% are AGN regardless of compactness, climbing to at least 80\% AGN for sources with F277W {\textendash} F444W > 1.6.

Models consider different seeding and accretion scenarios$^{4-7}$, which require the detection and characterization of black holes in the first few hundred million years after the Big Bang to be validated. Here we present an extensive analysis of the JWST-NIRSpec spectrum of GN-z11, an exceptionally luminous galaxy at z = 10.6, revealing the detection of the [NeIV]{\ensuremath{\lambda}}2423 and CII*{\ensuremath{\lambda}}1335 transitions (typical of active galactic nuclei), as well as semi-forbidden nebular lines tracing gas densities higher than {}10$^{9}$ cm$^{{\ensuremath{-}}3}$, typical of the broad line region of active galactic nuclei. These spectral features indicate that GN-z11 hosts an accreting black hole. The spectrum also reveals a deep and blueshifted CIV{\ensuremath{\lambda}}1549 absorption trough, tracing an outflow with velocity 800{\ensuremath{-}}1,000 km s$^{{\ensuremath{-}}1}$, probably driven by the active galactic nucleus. Assuming local virial relations, we derive a black hole mass of log (M$\_{BH}$/M$\_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$ ) =6.2 {\ensuremath{\pm}}0.3 , accreting at about five times the Eddington rate. These properties are consistent with both heavy seeds scenarios and scenarios considering intermediate and light seeds experiencing episodic super-Eddington phases. Our finding explains the high luminosity of GN-z11 and can also provide an explanation for its exceptionally high nitrogen abundance.}},

The coldest source, UNCOVER-BD-3, is near the T/Y dwarf boundary with T $\_{eff}$ = 550 K, and our analysis indicates the presence of PH$\_{3}$ in the 3{\textendash}5 {\ensuremath{\mu}}m region, favored over CO$\_{2}$ and a possible indicator of subsolar metallicity. We estimate distances of 0.9{\textendash}4.5 kpc from the Galactic midplane, making these the most distant brown dwarfs with spectroscopic confirmation. Population simulations indicate high probabilities of membership in the Galactic thick disk for two of these brown dwarfs, and potential halo membership for UNCOVER-BD-1. Our simulations indicate that there are approximately 5 T dwarfs and 1{\textendash}2 L dwarfs in the Abell 2744 field down to F444W = 30 AB mag, roughly one-third of which are thick disk members. These results highlight the utility of deep JWST/NIRSpec spectroscopy for identifying and characterizing the oldest metal-poor brown dwarfs in the Milky Way.}},

Together with existing Hubble Space Telescope (HST) imaging, this publicly available data set opens a fundamentally new discovery space to understand the remaining mysteries of the formation and evolution of galaxies across cosmic time. In this work, we detect and measure some 60,000 objects across the 49 arcmin$^{2}$ JWST footprint down to a 5{\ensuremath{\sigma}} limiting magnitude of \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde30 mag in 0.″32 apertures. Photometry is performed using circular apertures on images matched to the point-spread function (PSF) of the reddest NIRCam broad band, F444W, and cleaned of bright cluster galaxies and the related intracluster light. To give an impression of the photometric performance, we measure photometric redshifts and achieve a {\ensuremath{\sigma}} $\_{NMAD}$ {\ensuremath{\approx}} 0.03 based on known, but relatively small, spectroscopic samples. With this paper, we publicly release our HST and JWST PSF-matched photometric catalog with optimally assigned aperture sizes for easy use, along with single aperture catalogs, photometric redshifts, rest-frame colors, and individual magnification estimates. These catalogs will set the stage for efficient and deep spectroscopic follow up of some of the first JWST-selected samples in summer of 2023.}},

JWST and Hubble Space Telescope high- resolution images reveal that the majority of them show extended morphologies indicating significant contribution to the total lights from their host galaxies, except for three compact objects two of which show red spectral energy distributions, probably in a transition phase from faint AGNs to low luminosity quasars. Careful AGN-host decomposition analyses show that their host's stellar masses are systematically lower than the local relation between the black hole mass and the stellar mass, implying a fast black hole growth consistent with predictions from theoretical simulations. A high fraction of the broad-line AGNs (\raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde5\%), higher than z \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde 0, indicates that the number density of such faint AGNs is higher than an extrapolation of the quasar luminosity function, implying a large population of AGNs in the early universe.

By examining JWST galaxies at z = 4-7 that host H{\ensuremath{\alpha}}-detected black holes, we investigate (i) the high-z M $\_{{\textbullet}}$-M $\_{{\ensuremath{\star}}}$ relation and (ii) the black hole mass distribution, especially in its low-mass range (M $\_{{\textbullet}}$ {\ensuremath{\lesssim}} 10$^{6.5}$ M $\_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$). With a detailed statistical analysis, our findings conclusively reveal a high-z M $\_{{\textbullet}}$-M $\_{{\ensuremath{\star}}}$ relation that deviates at >3{\ensuremath{\sigma}} confidence level from the local relation. The high-z relation is $\mathrm{log}({M}\_{\bullet }/\,{M}\_{\odot })=-{2.43}\_{-0.83}^{+0 .83}+{1.06}\_{-0.09}^{+0.09}\mathrm{log}({M}\_{\star }/\,{M}\_{\odot })$ . Black holes are overmassive by \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde10-100{\texttimes} compared to their low-z counterparts in galactic hosts of the same stellar mass. This fact is not due to a selection effect in surveys. Moreover, our analysis predicts the possibility of detecting in high-z JWST surveys 5-15{\texttimes} more black holes with M $\_{{\textbullet}}$ {\ensuremath{\lesssim}} 10$^{6.5}$ M $\_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$, and 10-30{\texttimes} more with M $\_{{\textbullet}}$ {\ensuremath{\lesssim}} 10$^{8.5}$ M $\_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$, compared to local relation's predictions. The lighter black holes preferentially occupy galaxies with a stellar mass of \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde10$^{7.5}$-{}10$^{8}$ M $\_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$. We have yet to detect these sources because (i) they may be inactive (duty cycles 1\%-10\%), (ii) the host overshines the active galactic nucleus (AGN), or (iii) the AGN is obscured and not immediately recognizable by line diagnostics. A search of low-mass black holes in existing JWST surveys will further test the M $\_{{\textbullet}}$-M $\_{{\ensuremath{\star}}}$ relation. Current JWST fields represent a treasure trove of black hole systems at z = 4-7; their detection will provide crucial insights into their early evolution and coevolution with their galactic hosts.}},

    abstract = {{Deep observations with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) have revealed an emerging population of red pointlike sources that could provide a link between the postulated supermassive black hole seeds and observed quasars. In this work, we present a JWST/NIRSpec spectrum from the JWST Cycle 1 UNCOVER Treasury survey of a massive accreting black hole at z = 8.50 displaying a clear broad-line component as inferred from the H{\ensuremath{\beta}} line with FWHM = 3439 {\ensuremath{\pm}} 413 km s$^{-1}$, typical of the broad-line region of an active galactic nucleus (AGN). The AGN nature of this object is further supported by high ionization, as inferred from emission lines, and a point-source morphology. We compute a black hole mass of ${\mathrm{log}}\_{10}({M}\_{\mathrm{BH}}/{M}\_{\odot })=8.17\pm 0.42$ and a bolometric luminosity of L $\_{bol}$ \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde 6.6 {\texttimes} {}10$^{45}$ erg s$^{-1}$. These values imply that our object is accreting at \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde40\% of the Eddington limit. Detailed modeling of the spectral energy distribution in the optical and near-infrared, together with constraints from ALMA, indicate an upper limit on the stellar mass of ${\mathrm{log}}\_{10}({M}\_{* }/{M}\_{\odot }) 8.7$ , which would lead to an unprecedented ratio of black hole to host mass of at least \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde30\%. This is orders of magnitude higher compared to the local QSOs but consistent with recent AGN studies at high redshift with JWST. This finding suggests that a nonnegligible fraction of supermassive black holes either started out from massive seeds and/or grew at a super-Eddington rate at high redshift. Given the predicted number densities of high-z faint AGN, future NIRSpec observations of larger samples will allow us to further investigate galaxy-black hole coevolution in the early Universe.}},

    abstract = {{We present the JWST cycle 1 53.8 h medium program FRESCO, short for 'First Reionization Epoch Spectroscopically Complete Observations'. FRESCO covers 62 arcmin$^{2}$ in each of the two GOODS/CANDELS fields for a total area of 124 arcmin$^{2}$ exploiting JWST's powerful new grism spectroscopic capabilities at near-infrared wavelengths. By obtaining \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde2 h deep NIRCam/grism observations with the F444W filter, FRESCO yields unprecedented spectra at R \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde 1600 covering 3.8-5.0 {\textmu}m for most galaxies in the NIRCam field of view. This setup enables emission line measurements over most of cosmic history, from strong PAH lines at z \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde 0.2-0.5, to Pa {\ensuremath{\alpha}} and Pa {\ensuremath{\beta}} at z \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde 1-3, He I and [S III] at z \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde 2.5-4.5, H {\ensuremath{\alpha}} and [N II] at z \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde 5-6.5, up to [O III] and H {\ensuremath{\beta}} for z \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde 7-9 galaxies. FRESCO's grism observations provide total line fluxes for accurately estimating galaxy stellar masses and calibrating slit-loss corrections of NIRSpec/MSA spectra in the same field. Additionally, FRESCO results in a mosaic of F182M, F210M, and F444W imaging in the same fields to a depth of \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde28.2 mag (5{\ensuremath{\sigma}} in 0${\_{.}^{\prime\prime}}$32 diameter apertures). Here, we describe the overall survey design and the key science goals that can be addressed with FRESCO. We also highlight several, early science results, including: spectroscopic redshifts of Lyman break galaxies that were identified almost 20 yr ago, the discovery of broad-line active galactic nuclei at z > 4, and resolved Pa {\ensuremath{\alpha}} maps of galaxies at z \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde 1.4.

    abstract = {{Spitzer/Infrared Array Camera (IRAC) imaging has revealed that the brightest z \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde 7-8 galaxies often exhibit young ages and strong nebular line emission, hinting at high ionizing efficiency among early galaxies. However, IRAC's limited sensitivity has long hindered efforts to study the fainter, more numerous population often thought largely responsible for reionization. Here, we use Cosmic Evolution Early Release Science (CEERS) JWST/NIRCam data to characterize 116 ultraviolet (UV)-faint (median M$\_{UV}$ = -19.5) z \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde 6.5-8 galaxies. The spectral energy distributions are typically dominated by young (\raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde10-50 Myr), low-mass (M$\_{*}$ \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde {}10$^{8}$ M$\_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$) stellar populations, and we find no need for extremely high stellar masses (\raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde{}10$^{11}$ M$\_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$). Considering previous studies of UV- bright (M$\_{UV}$ \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde -22) z \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde 7-8 galaxies, we find evidence for a strong (5-10 times) increase in specific star formation rate (sSFR) toward lower luminosities (median sSFR = 103 Gyr$^{-1}$ in CEERS). The larger sSFRs imply a more dominant contribution from OB stars in the relatively numerous UV-faint population, perhaps suggesting that these galaxies are very efficient ionizing agents (median {\ensuremath{\xi}}$\_{ion}$ = 10$^{25.7}$ erg$^{-1}$ Hz). In spite of the much larger sSFRs, we find little increase in [O III] + H {\ensuremath{\beta}} equivalent widths towards fainter M$\_{UV}$ (median {\ensuremath{\approx}}780 $\mathrm{\mathring{A}}$). If confirmed, this may indicate that a substantial fraction of our CEERS galaxies possess extremely low metallicities ({\ensuremath{\lesssim}}3 per cent Z$\_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$) where [O III] emission is suppressed. Alternatively, high ionizing photon escape fractions or bursty star formation histories can also weaken the nebular lines in a subset of our sample. While the majority of galaxies in our sample are very blue (median {\ensuremath{\beta}} = -2.0), we identify a significant tail of very dusty galaxies ({\ensuremath{\beta}} \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde -1) at {\ensuremath{\approx}}0.5$L\_\mathrm{UV}^\ast$ which may contribute significantly to the z \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde 7-8 star formation rate density.}},

Here we fit S{\'e}rsic profiles to the F200W NIRCam images of the 13 massive galaxy candidates of Labb{\'e} et al., to determine their structural parameters. Satisfactory fits were obtained for nine galaxies. We find that their effective radii are extremely small, ranging from r $\_{e}$ \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde 80 pc to r $\_{e}$ \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde 300 pc, with a mean of <r $\_{e}$> {\ensuremath{\approx}} 150 pc. For their apparent stellar masses, the galaxies are smaller than any other galaxy population that has been observed at any other redshift. We use the fits to derive circularized three-dimensional stellar mass profiles of the galaxies, and compare these to the mass profiles of massive quiescent galaxies at z \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde 2.3 and nearby elliptical galaxies. Despite the fact that the high-redshift galaxies have 10-20 times smaller half-light radii than their putative descendants, the central stellar densities are very similar. The most straightforward interpretation is that the dense compact inner regions of the most massive ellipticals today were already in place \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde600 Myr after the Big Bang. We caution that the redshifts and masses of the galaxies remain to be confirmed, and that the complex NIRCam point-spread function is not yet fully characterized.}},

    abstract = {{The James Webb Space Telescope is now detecting early black holes (BHs) as they transition from ``seeds'' to supermassive BHs. Recently, Bogdan et al. reported the detection of an X-ray luminous supermassive BH, UHZ-1, with a photometric redshift at z > 10. Such an extreme source at this very high redshift provides new insights on seeding and growth models for BHs given the short time available for formation and growth. Harnessing the exquisite sensitivity of JWST/NIRSpec, here we report the spectroscopic confirmation of UHZ-1 at z = 10.073 {\ensuremath{\pm}} 0.002. We find that the NIRSpec/Prism spectrum is typical of recently discovered z {\ensuremath{\approx}} 10 galaxies, characterized primarily by star formation features. We see no clear evidence of the powerful X-ray source in the rest-frame UV/optical spectrum, which may suggest heavy obscuration of the central BH, in line with the Compton-thick column density measured in the X-rays. We perform a stellar population fit simultaneously to the new NIRSpec spectroscopy and previously available photometry. The fit yields a stellar-mass estimate for the host galaxy that is significantly better constrained than prior photometric estimates ( ${M}\_{\star }\sim {1.4}\_{-0.4}^{+0.3}\times {10}^{8}$ M $\_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$). Given the predicted BH mass (M $\_{BH}$ \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde {}10$^{7}$-{}10$^{8}$ M $\_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$), the resulting ratio of M $\_{BH}$/M $\_{{\ensuremath{\star}}}$ remains 2 to 3 orders of magnitude higher than local values, thus lending support to the heavy seeding channel for the formation of supermassive BHs within the first billion years of cosmic evolution.}},

    abstract = {{We report on the discovery of two low-luminosity, broad-line active galactic nuclei (AGNs) at z > 5 identified using JWST NIRSpec spectroscopy from the Cosmic Evolution Early Release Science (CEERS) survey. We detect broad H{\ensuremath{\alpha}} emission in the spectra of both sources, with FWHM of 2060 {\ensuremath{\pm}} 290 km s$^{‑1}$ and 1800 {\ensuremath{\pm}} 200 km s$^{‑1}$, resulting in virial black hole (BH) masses that are 1{\textendash}2 dex below those of existing samples of luminous quasars at z > 5. The first source, CEERS 2782 at z = 5.242, is 2{\textendash}3 dex fainter than known quasars at similar redshifts and was previously identified as a candidate low-luminosity AGN based on its morphology and rest-frame optical spectral energy distribution (SED). We measure a BH mass of M $\_{BH}$ = (1.3 {\ensuremath{\pm}} 0.4) {\texttimes} {}10$^{7}$ M $\_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$, confirming that this AGN is powered by the least massive BH known in the Universe at the end of cosmic reionization. The second source, CEERS 746 at z = 5.624, is inferred to be a heavily obscured, broad-line AGN caught in a transition phase between a dust-obscured starburst and an unobscured quasar. We estimate its BH mass to be in the range of M $\_{BH}$ ≃ (0.9{\textendash}4.7) {\texttimes} {}10$^{7}$ M $\_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$, depending on the level of dust obscuration assumed. We perform SED fitting to derive host stellar masses, M $\_{{\ensuremath{\star}}}$, allowing us to place constraints on the BH{\textendash}galaxy mass relationship in the lowest mass range yet probed in the early Universe. The M $\_{BH}$/M $\_{{\ensuremath{\star}}}$ ratio for CEERS 2782, in particular, is consistent with or higher than the empirical relationship seen in massive galaxies at z = 0. We examine the narrow emission line ratios of both sources and find that their location on the BPT and OHNO diagrams is consistent with model predictions for moderately low metallicity AGNs with Z/Z $\_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$ ≃ 0.2{\textendash}0.4. The spectroscopic identification of low-luminosity, broad-line AGNs at z > 5 with M $\_{BH}$ ≃ {}10$^{7}$ M $\_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$ demonstrates the capability of JWST to push BH masses closer to the range predicted for the BH seed population and provides a unique opportunity to study the early stages of BH{\textendash}galaxy assembly.}},

We derive a redshift of z = 10.603 (lower than previous determinations) based on multiple emission lines in our low and medium resolution spectra over 0.7 {\ensuremath{-}} 5.3 {\ensuremath{\mu}}m. We significantly detect the continuum and measure a blue rest-UV spectral slope of {\ensuremath{\beta}} = {\ensuremath{-}}2.4. Remarkably, we see spatially extended Lyman-{\ensuremath{\alpha}} in emission (despite the highly neutral intergalactic medium expected at this early epoch), offset 555 km s$^{{\ensuremath{-}}1}$ redwards of the systemic redshift. From our measurements of collisionally excited lines of both low and high ionisation (including [O II] {\ensuremath{\lambda}}3727, [Ne III] {\ensuremath{\lambda}}3869, and C III] {\ensuremath{\lambda}}1909), we infer a high ionisation parameter (log U {\ensuremath{\sim}} {\ensuremath{-}}2). We detect the rarely seen N IV] {\ensuremath{\lambda}}1486 and N III] {\ensuremath{\lambda}}1748 lines in both our low and medium resolution spectra, with other high ionisation lines seen in the low resolution spectrum, such as He II (blended with O III]) and C IV (with a possible P-Cygni profile). Based on the observed rest-UV line ratios, we cannot conclusively rule out photoionisation from an active galactic nucleus (AGN), although the high C III]/He II and N III]/He II ratios are compatible with a star formation explanation. If the observed emission lines are powered by star formation, then the strong N III] {\ensuremath{\lambda}}1748 observed may imply an unusually high N/O abundance. Balmer emission lines (H{\ensuremath{\gamma}}, H{\ensuremath{\delta}}) are also detected, and if powered by star formation rather than an AGN, we infer a star formation rate of {\ensuremath{\sim}}20 {\ensuremath{-}} 30 M$\_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$ yr$^{{\ensuremath{-}}1}$ (depending on the initial mass function) and low dust attenuation. Our NIRSpec spectroscopy confirms that GN-z11 is a remarkable galaxy with extreme properties seen 430 Myr after the Big Bang.}},

The design of COSMOS-Web is motivated by three primary science goals: (1) to discover thousands of galaxies in the Epoch of Reionization (6 {\ensuremath{\lesssim}} z {\ensuremath{\lesssim}} 11) and map reionization's spatial distribution, environments, and drivers on scales sufficiently large to mitigate cosmic variance, (2) to identify hundreds of rare quiescent galaxies at z > 4 and place constraints on the formation of the universe's most-massive galaxies (M $\_{{\ensuremath{\star}}}$ > {}10$^{10}$ M $\_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$), and (3) directly measure the evolution of the stellar-mass-to-halo-mass relation using weak gravitational lensing out to z \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde 2.5 and measure its variance with galaxies' star formation histories and morphologies. In addition, we anticipate COSMOS- Web's legacy value to reach far beyond these scientific goals, touching many other areas of astrophysics, such as the identification of the first direct collapse black hole candidates, ultracool subdwarf stars in the Galactic halo, and possibly the identification of z > 10 pair-instability supernovae. In this paper we provide an overview of the survey's key measurements, specifications, goals, and prospects for new discovery.}},

    abstract = {{We present rest-frame optical data of the compact z = 5.55 galaxy GS\_3073 obtained using the integral field spectroscopy mode of the Near-InfraRed Spectrograph on board the James Webb Space Telescope. The galaxy's prominent broad components in several hydrogen and helium lines (though absent in the forbidden lines) and v detection of a large equivalent width of He II{\ensuremath{\lambda}}4686, EW(He II) {\ensuremath{\sim}}20 {\r{A}}, unambiguously identify it as an active galactic nucleus (AGN). We measured a gas phase metallicity of Z$\_{gas}$/Z$\_{{\en suremath{\odot}}}${\ensuremath{\sim}}0.21$\_{{\ensuremath{-}}0.04 }$$^{+0.08}$ , which is lower than what has been inferred for both more luminous AGN at a similar redshift and lower redshift AGN. We empirically show that classical emission line ratio diagnostic diagrams cannot be used to distinguish between the primary ionisation source (AGN or star formation) for systems with such low metallicity, though different diagnostic diagrams involving He II{\ensuremath{\lambda}}4686 prove very useful, independent of metallicity. We measured the central black hole mass to be log(M$\_{BH}$/M$\_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$){\ensuremath{\sim}}8.2 {\ensuremath{\pm}} 0.4 based on the luminosity and width of the broad line region of the H{\ensuremath{\alpha}} emission. While this places GS\_3073 at the lower end of known high-redshift black hole masses, it still appears to be overly massive when compared to its host galaxy's mass properties. We detected an outflow with a projected velocity {\ensuremath{\gtrsim}}700 km s$^{{\ensuremath{-}}1}$ and inferred an ionised gas mass outflow rate of about 100 M$\_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$ yr$^{{\ensuremath{-}}1}$, suggesting that one billion years after the Big Bang, GS\_3073 is able to enrich the intergalactic medium with metals.}},

All three images are very compact, i.e., unresolved, with a delensed size upper limit of r $\_{ e }$ {\ensuremath{\lesssim}} 35 pc. The images have apparent magnitudes of m $\_{F444W}$ \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde 25-26 AB, and the magnification-corrected absolute UV magnitude of the source is M $\_{UV,1450}$ = -16.81 {\ensuremath{\pm}} 0.09. From the sum of observed fluxes and from a spectral energy distribution (SED) analysis, we obtain estimates of the bolometric luminosities of the source of L $\_{bol}$ {\ensuremath{\gtrsim}} {}10$^{43}$ erg s$^{-1}$ and L $\_{bol}$ \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde {}10$^{44}$-{}10$^{46}$ erg s$^{-1}$, respectively. Based on its compact, point-like appearance, its position in color-color space, and the SED analysis, we tentatively conclude that this object is a UV-faint dust-obscured quasar-like object, i.e., an active galactic nucleus at high redshift. We also discuss other alternative origins for the object's emission features, including a massive star cluster, Population III, supermassive, or dark stars, or a direct-collapse black hole. Although populations of red galaxies at similar photometric redshifts have been detected with JWST, this object is unique in that its high-redshift nature is corroborated geometrically by lensing, that it is unresolved despite being magnified-and thus intrinsically even more compact-and that it occupies notably distinct regions in both size-luminosity and color-color space. Planned UNCOVER JWST/NIRSpec observations, scheduled in Cycle 1, will enable a more detailed analysis of this object.}},

This galaxy, denoted here as CEERS\_1019, was previously discovered as a Ly{\ensuremath{\alpha}}-break galaxy by Hubble with a Ly{\ensuremath{\alpha}} redshift from Keck. As part of the Cosmic Evolution Early Release Science (CEERS) survey, we have observed this source with JWST/NIRSpec, MIRI, NIRCam, and NIRCam/WFSS and uncovered a plethora of emission lines. The H{\ensuremath{\beta}} line is best fit by a narrow plus a broad component, where the latter is measured at 2.5{\ensuremath{\sigma}} with an FWHM \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde1200 km s$^{-1}$. We conclude this originates in the broadline region of an active galactic nucleus (AGN). This is supported by the presence of weak high- ionization lines (N V, N IV], and C III]), as well as a spatial point-source component. The implied mass of the black hole (BH) is log (M $\_{BH}$/M $\_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$) = 6.95 {\ensuremath{\pm}} 0.37, and we estimate that it is accreting at 1.2 {\ensuremath{\pm}} 0.5 times the Eddington limit. The 1-8 {\ensuremath{\mu}}m photometric spectral energy distribution shows a continuum dominated by starlight and constrains the host galaxy to be massive (log M/M$\_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$ \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde9.5) and highly star-forming (star formation rate, or SFR \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde 30 M$\_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$ yr$^{-1}$; log sSFR \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde - 7.9 yr$^{-1}$). The line ratios show that the gas is metal-poor (Z/Z $\_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$ \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde 0.1), dense (n $\_{ e }$ \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde {}10$^{3}$ cm$^{-3}$), and highly ionized (log U \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde - 2.1). We use this present highest-redshift AGN discovery to place constraints on BH seeding models and find that a combination of either super- Eddington accretion from stellar seeds or Eddington accretion from very massive BH seeds is required to form this object.}},

    abstract = {{The extremely rapid assembly of the earliest galaxies during the first billion years of cosmic history is a major challenge for our understanding of galaxy formation physics$^{1-5}$. The advent of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has exacerbated this issue by confirming the existence of galaxies in substantial numbers as early as the first few hundred million years$^{6-8}$. Perhaps even more surprisingly, in some galaxies, this initial highly efficient star formation rapidly shuts down, or quenches, giving rise to massive quiescent galaxies as little as 1.5 billion years after the Big Bang$^{9,10}$. However, due to their faintness and red colour, it has proven extremely challenging to learn about these extreme quiescent galaxies, or to confirm whether any existed at earlier times. Here we report the spectroscopic confirmation of a massive quiescent galaxy, GS-9209, at redshift, z = 4.658, just 1.25 billion years after the Big Bang, using the JWST Near-Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSpec). From these data we infer a stellar mass of M$\_{*}$ = 3.8 {\ensuremath{\pm}} 0.2 {\texttimes} {}10$^{10}$ M$\_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$, which formed over a roughly 200 Myr period before this galaxy quenched its star-formation activity at z =6.5$\_{-0.5}$$^{+0.2}$ , when the Universe was approximately 800 Myr old. This galaxy is both a likely descendent of the highest-redshift submillimetre galaxies and quasars, and a likely progenitor for the dense, ancient cores of the most massive local galaxies.}},

An immediate concern is the consistency of these candidates with galaxy formation in the standard {\ensuremath{\Lambda}}CDM cosmological model, wherein the stellar mass (M$\_{{\ensuremath{\star}}}$) of a galaxy is limited by the available baryonic reservoir of its host dark matter halo. The mass function of dark matter haloes therefore imposes an absolute upper limit on the number density n (>M$\_{{\ensuremath{\star}}}$, z) and stellar mass density {\ensuremath{\rho}}$\_{{\ensuremath{\star}}}$ (>M$\_{{\ensuremath{\star}}}$, z) of galaxies more massive than M$\_{{\ensuremath{\star}}}$ at any epoch z.

CEERS, one of 13 JWST ERS programs, targets galaxy formation from z \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde 0.5 to >10 using several imaging and spectroscopic modes. We make use of the first epoch of CEERS NIRCam imaging, spanning 35.5 arcmin$^{2}$, to search for candidate galaxies at z > 9. Following a detailed data reduction process implementing several custom steps to produce high-quality reduced images, we perform multiband photometry across seven NIRCam broad- and medium-band (and six Hubble broadband) filters focusing on robust colors and accurate total fluxes. We measure photometric redshifts and devise a robust set of selection criteria to identify a sample of 26 galaxy candidates at z \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde 9-16. These objects are compact with a median half-light radius of \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde0.5 kpc. We present an early estimate of the z \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde 11 rest-frame ultraviolet (UV) luminosity function, finding that the number density of galaxies at M $\_{UV}$ \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde -20 appears to evolve very little from z \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde 9 to 11. We also find that the abundance (surface density [arcmin$^{-2}$]) of our candidates exceeds nearly all theoretical predictions. We explore potential implications, including that at z > 10, star formation may be dominated by top-heavy initial mass functions, which would result in an increased ratio of UV light per unit halo mass, though a complete lack of dust attenuation and/or changing star formation physics may also play a role. While spectroscopic confirmation of these sources is urgently required, our results suggest that the deeper views to come with JWST should yield prolific samples of ultrahigh-redshift galaxies with which to further explore these conclusions.}},

    abstract = {{We report a candidate of a low-luminosity active galactic nucleus (AGN) at z = 5 that was selected from the first near-infrared images of the JWST CEERS project. This source, named CEERS-AGN-z5-1 at absolute 1450 {\r{A}} magnitude M $\_{1450}$ = -19.5 {\ensuremath{\pm}} 0.3, was found via a visual selection of compact sources from a catalog of Lyman break galaxies at z > 4, taking advantage of the superb spatial resolution of the JWST/NIRCam images. The 20 photometric data available from CFHT, Hubble Space Telescope, Spitzer, and JWST suggest that the continuum shape of this source is reminiscent of that for an unobscured AGN, and there is a clear color excess in the filters where the redshifted H{\ensuremath{\beta}}+[O III] and H{\ensuremath{\alpha}} are covered. The estimated line luminosity is L $\_{H{\ensuremath{\beta}}+[O III]}$ = 10$^{43.0}$ erg s$^{-1}$ and L $\_{H{\ensuremath{\alpha}} }$ = 10$^{42.9}$ erg s$^{-1}$ with the corresponding rest-frame equivalent width EW$\_{H{\ensuremath{\beta}}+[O III]}$ = 1100 {\r{A}} and EW$\_{H{\ensuremath{\alpha}} }$ = 1600 {\r{A}}, respectively. Our spectral energy distribution fitting analysis favors the scenario that this object is either a strong broad-line emitter or even a super-Eddington accreting black hole (BH), although a possibility of an extremely young galaxy with moderate dust attenuation is not completely ruled out. The bolometric luminosity, L $\_{bol}$ = 2.5 {\ensuremath{\pm}} 0.3 {\texttimes} {}10$^{44}$ erg s$^{-1}$, is consistent with those of z < 0.35 broad-line AGNs with M $\_{BH}$ \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde {}10$^{6}$ M $\_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$ accreting at the Eddington limit. This new AGN population in the first 1.1 billion years of the universe may close the gap between the observed BH mass range at high redshift and that of BH seeds. Spectroscopic confirmation is awaited to secure the redshift and its AGN nature.}},

    abstract = {{Understanding how super-massive black holes form and grow in the early Universe has become a major challenge$^{1,2}$ since it was discovered that luminous quasars existed only 700 million years after the Big Bang$^{3,4}$. Simulations indicate an evolutionary sequence of dust-reddened quasars emerging from heavily dust- obscured starbursts that then transition to unobscured luminous quasars by expelling gas and dust$^{5}$. Although the last phase has been identified out to a redshift of 7.6 (ref. $^{6}$), a transitioning quasar has not been found at similar redshifts owing to their faintness at optical and near-infrared wavelengths. Here we report observations of an ultraviolet compact object, GNz7q, associated with a dust-enshrouded starburst at a redshift of 7.1899 {\ensuremath{\pm}} 0.0005. The host galaxy is more luminous in dust emission than any other known object at this epoch, forming 1,600 solar masses of stars per year within a central radius of 480 parsec. A red point source in the far-ultraviolet is identified in deep, high- resolution imaging and slitless spectroscopy. GNz7q is extremely faint in X-rays, which indicates the emergence of a uniquely ultraviolet compact star-forming region or a Compton-thick super-Eddington black-hole accretion disk at the dusty starburst core. In the latter case, the observed properties are consistent with predictions from cosmological simulations$^{7}$ and suggest that GNz7q is an antecedent to unobscured luminous quasars at later epochs.}},

RUBIES-UDS-QG-z7 was selected from public JWST/NIRCam and MIRI imaging from the PRIMER survey and observed with JWST/NIRSpec as part of RUBIES. The NIRSpec/PRISM spectrum reveals one of the strongest Balmer breaks observed thus far at z > 6, with no emission lines but tentative Balmer and Ca absorption features, as well as a Lyman break. Simultaneous modeling of the NIRSpec/PRISM spectrum and NIRCam and MIRI photometry (spanning 0.9{\textendash}18 {\ensuremath{\mu}}m) shows that the galaxy formed a stellar mass of log<inline-formula> </inline-formula> before z {\ensuremath{\sim}} 8 and ceased forming stars 50{\textendash}100 Myr prior to the time of observation, resulting in <inline-formula> </inline-formula>.

The 3D stellar-mass density profile of RUBIES-UDS-QG-z7 is remarkably similar to the central densities of local massive ellipticals, suggesting that at least some of their cores may have already been in place at z > 7. The discovery of RUBIES-UDS-QG-z7 has strong implications for galaxy formation models: the estimated number density of quiescent galaxies at z {\ensuremath{\sim}} 7 is >100 {\texttimes} larger than predicted from any model to date, indicating that quiescent galaxies have formed earlier than previously expected.}},

These data were obtained with JWST NIRSpec as part of the Early eXtragalactic Continuum and Emission Line Science (EXCELS) survey, which we introduce in this work. The first two galaxies are newly selected from PRIMER UDS imaging, both at <inline-formula><tex-math id=``TM0004'' notation=``LaTeX''>$z=4.62$</tex-math></inline-formula> and separated by 860 pkpc on the sky, within a larger structure for which we confirm several other members.

These systems could plausibly merge by the present day to produce a local massive elliptical galaxy.

We finally evaluate whether these four galaxies are consistent with the <inline-formula><tex-math id=``TM0010'' notation=``LaTeX''>$\Lambda$</tex-math></inline-formula>-CDM halo-mass function using an extreme value statistics approach.

However, these objects roughly align with the most massive galaxies expected under the assumption of 100 per cent conversion of baryons to stars (<inline-formula><tex-math id=``TM0014'' notation=``LaTeX''>$f\_*$</tex-math></inline- formula>=1).

The objects are small and of low stellar mass ({\ensuremath{\sim}}1 kpc; M$\_{*}$ {\ensuremath{\sim}} 10$^{7 {\ensuremath{-}} 9}$ M$\_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$), less massive than any galaxy studied kinematically at z > 1 thus far. The cold gas masses implied by the observed star formation rates are about ten times higher than the stellar masses. We find that their ionised gas is spatially resolved by JWST, with evidence for broadened lines and spatial velocity gradients. Using a simple thin-disc model, we fit these data with a novel forward- modelling software that accounts for the complex geometry, point spread function, and pixellation of the NIRSpec instrument. We find the sample to include both rotation- and dispersion- dominated structures, as we detect velocity gradients of v(r$\_{e}$){\ensuremath{\sim}}100 {\ensuremath{-}} 150 km s$^{{\ensuremath{-}}1}$, and we find velocity dispersions of {\ensuremath{\sigma}}$\_{0}$ {\ensuremath{\sim}} 30 {\ensuremath{-}} 70 km s$^{{\ensuremath{-}}1}$ that are comparable to those at cosmic noon. The dynamical masses implied by these models (M$\_{dyn}$ {\ensuremath{\sim}} 10$^{9 {\ensuremath{-}} 10}$ M$\_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$) are higher than the stellar masses by up to a factor 40, and they are higher than the total baryonic mass (gas + stars) by a factor of {\ensuremath{\sim}}3. Qualitatively, this result is robust even if the observed velocity gradients reflect ongoing mergers rather than rotating discs. Unless the observed emission line kinematics is dominated by outflows, this implies that the centres of these galaxies are dominated by dark matter or that star formation is three times less efficient, leading to higher inferred gas masses.}},

We fit these sources using multiple models of substellar atmospheres and present the resulting fluxes, sizes, effective temperatures, and other derived properties for the sample. If confirmed, these fits place the majority of the sources in the Milky Way thick disk and halo. We observe proper motions for seven of the candidate brown dwarfs, with directions in agreement with the plane of our Galaxy, providing evidence that they are not extragalactic in nature. We demonstrate how the colors of these sources differ from selected high-redshift galaxies, and explore the selection of these sources in planned large-area JWST NIRCam surveys. Deep imaging with JWST/NIRCam presents an an excellent opportunity for finding and understanding these ultracool dwarfs at kiloparsec distances.}},

    abstract = {{We present a new parametric lens model for the massive galaxy cluster Abell 2744 based on new ultra-deep JWST imaging taken in the framework of the UNCOVER program. These observations constitute the deepest JWST images of a lensing cluster to date, adding to existing deep Hubble Space Telescope (HST) images and the recent JWST Early Release Science and Director's Discretionary Time data taken for this field. The wide field of view of UNCOVER (\raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde45 arcmin$^{2}$) extends beyond the cluster's well-studied central core and reveals a spectacular wealth of prominent lensed features around two massive cluster sub-structures in the north and north-west, where no multiple images were previously known. We identify 75 new multiple images and candidates of 17 sources, 43 of which allow us, for the first time, to constrain the lensing properties and total mass distribution around these extended cluster structures using strong lensing (SL). Our model yields an effective Einstein radius of {\ensuremath{\theta}}$\_{E, main}$ = 23.2 {\ensuremath{\pm}} 2.3 arcsec for the main cluster core (for z$\_{s}$ = 2), enclosing a mass of M(< {\ensuremath{\theta}}$\_{E, main}$) = (7.7 {\ensuremath{\pm}} 1.1) {\texttimes} {}10$^{13}$ M$\_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$, and {\ensuremath{\theta}}$\_{E, NW}$ = 13.1 {\ensuremath{\pm}} 1.3 arcsec for the newly discovered north-western SL structure enclosing M(< {\ensuremath{\theta}}$\_{E, NW}$) = (2.2 {\ensuremath{\pm}} 0.3) {\texttimes} {}10$^{13}$ M$\_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$. The northern clump is somewhat less massive with {\ensuremath{\theta}}$\_{E, N}$ = 7.4 {\ensuremath{\pm}} 0.7 arcsec enclosing M(< {\ensuremath{\theta}}$\_{E, N}$) = (0.8 {\ensuremath{\pm}} 0.1) {\texttimes} {}10$^{13}$ M$\_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$. We find the northern sub-structures of Abell 2744 to broadly agree with the findings from weak lensing analyses and align with the filamentary structure found by these previous studies. Our model in particular reveals a large area of high magnification values between the various cluster structures, which will be paramount for lensed galaxy studies in the UNCOVER field. The model is made publicly available to accompany the first UNCOVER data release.}},

    abstract = {{The new capabilities that JWST offers in the near- and mid-infrared (IR) are used to investigate in unprecedented detail the nature of optical/near-IR-faint, mid-IR-bright sources, with HST-dark galaxies among them. We gather JWST data from the CEERS survey in the Extended Groth Strip, jointly with HST data, and analyze spatially resolved optical-to-mid-IR spectral energy distributions to estimate photometric redshifts in two dimensions and stellar population properties on a pixel-by-pixel basis for red galaxies detected by NIRCam. We select 138 galaxies with F150W ‑ F356W > 1.5 mag and F356W < 27.5 mag. The nature of these sources is threefold: (1) 71\% are dusty star- forming galaxies (SFGs) at 2 < z < 6 with and a variety of specific SFRs (<1 to >100 Gyr$^{‑1}$); (2) 18\% are quiescent/dormant (i.e., subject to reignition/rejuvenation) galaxies (QGs) at 3 < z < 5, with and poststarburst mass- weighted ages (0.5{\textendash}1.0 Gyr); and (3) 11\% are strong young starbursts with indications of high equivalent width emission lines (typically, [O III]+H{\ensuremath{\beta}}) at 6 < z < 7 (XELG-z6) and . The sample is dominated by disk-like galaxies with remarkable compactness for XELG-z6 (effective radii smaller than 0.4 kpc). Large attenuations in SFGs, 2 < A(V) < 5 mag, are found within 1.5 times the effective radius, approximately 2 kpc, while QGs present A(V) {\ensuremath{\sim}} 0.2 mag. Our SED-fitting technique reproduces the expected dust emission luminosities of IR-bright and submillimeter galaxies. This study implies high levels of star formation activity between z {\ensuremath{\sim}} 20 and z {\ensuremath{\sim}} 10, where virtually 100\% of our galaxies had already formed {}10$^{8}$ M $\_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$, 60\% had assembled {}10$^{9}$ M $\_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$, and 10\% up to {}10$^{10}$ M $\_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$ (in situ or ex situ).}},

Here we provide a detailed description of each step in our reduction and a discussion of future expected improvements. Our reduction process includes corrections for known prelaunch issues such as 1/f noise, as well as in-flight issues including snowballs, wisps, and astrometric alignment. Many of our custom reduction processes were first developed with prelaunch simulated NIRCam imaging over the full 10 CEERS NIRCam pointings. We present a description of the creation and reduction of this simulated data set in the Appendix.

In some cases, these objects might even reach half the stellar mass inferred for the galaxy. It has become a great challenging for theoretical models to understand how these objects formed and grew to these masses. Different ideas range from heavy seed to super-Eddington accretion phases. We take a different approach and try to infer how accurate these MBH mass estimates are and whether we really need to revise our physical models. By considering how the emerging spectrum (both the continuum and the broad lines) of an accreting MBH changes close to and above the Eddington limit, we infer a much larger uncertainty in the MBH mass estimates relative to that of local counterparts. The uncertainty is up to an order of magnitude. We also infer a potential preference for lower masses and higher accretion rates, which i) moves accreting MBHs closer to the local correlations, and ii) might indicate that we witness a widespread phase of very rapid accretion for the first time.}},

We obtain deep NIRCam imaging in the F115W, F200W, and F356W bands, as well as F356W grism spectroscopy of the quasars. We use bright unsaturated stars to construct models of the point-spread functions (PSFs) and estimate the errors of these PSFs. We then measure or constrain the fluxes and morphology of the quasar host galaxies by fitting the quasar images as a point source plus an exponential disk. We successfully detect the host galaxies of three quasars, which have host-to-quasar-flux ratios of {\ensuremath{\sim}}1\%{\textendash}5\%. Spectral energy distribution fitting suggests that these quasar host galaxies have stellar masses of M $\_{*}$ {\ensuremath{\gtrsim}} {}10$^{10}$ M $\_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$. For quasars with host galaxy nondetections, we estimate the upper limits of their stellar masses. We use the grism spectra to measure the H{\ensuremath{\beta}} line profile and the continuum luminosity, then estimate the SMBH masses for the quasars. Our results indicate that the positive relation between SMBH masses and host galaxy stellar masses already exists at redshift z {\ensuremath{\gtrsim}} 6. The quasars in our sample show a high BH-to-stellar-mass ratio of M $\_{BH}$/M $\_{*}$ {\ensuremath{\sim}} 0.15, which is about {\ensuremath{\sim}}2 dex higher than local relations. We find that selection effects only contribute partially to the high M $\_{BH}$/M $\_{*}$ ratios of high-redshift quasars. This result hints at a possible redshift evolution of the M $\_{BH}${\textendash}M $\_{*}$ relation.}},

We identify 16 BHAEs with FWHM of the broad components spanning from {\ensuremath{\sim}}1000 to 3000 km s$^{‑1}$. Assuming that the broad line widths arise as a result of Doppler broadening around BHs, the implied BH masses range from {}10$^{7}$ to {}10$^{8}$ M $\_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$, with broad H{\ensuremath{\alpha}}-converted bolometric luminosities of 10$^{44.5}${\textendash}10$^{45.5}$ erg s$^{‑1}$ and Eddington ratios of 0.07{\textendash}0.47. The spatially extended structure of the F200W stacked image may trace the stellar light from the host galaxies. The H{\ensuremath{\alpha}} luminosity function indicates an increasing AGN fraction toward the higher H{\ensuremath{\alpha}} luminosities. We find possible evidence for clustering of BHAEs: two sources are at the same redshift with a projected separation of 519 kpc; one BHAE appears as a composite system residing in an overdense region with three close companion H{\ensuremath{\alpha}} emitters. Three BHAEs exhibit blueshifted absorption troughs indicative of the presence of high column density gas. We find that the broad- line-selected and photometrically selected BHAE samples exhibit different distributions in the optical continuum slopes, which can be attributed to their different selection methods. The ASPIRE broad-line H{\ensuremath{\alpha}} sample provides a good database for future studies of faint AGN populations at high redshift.}},

These extremely red objects (JWST-EROs) exhibit spectral energy distributions (SEDs) that are difficult to explain using a single component of either star-forming galaxies or quasars, leading to two-component models in which the blue UV and extremely red optical are explained using less-dusty and dusty spectra of galaxies or quasars, respectively. Here, we report the remarkable similarity in SEDs between JWST-EROs and blue-excess dust-obscured galaxies (BluDOGs) identified at 2 < z < 3. BluDOGs are a population of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) with black hole masses of \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde10$^{8-9}$ M $\_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$, which are 1 order of magnitude larger than those in some JWST-EROs. The Eddington ratios of BluDOGs are 1 or higher, whereas those of JWST-EROs are in the range of 0.1-1. Therefore, JWST-EROs are less massive, less active, and more common counterparts in higher-z of BluDOGs in cosmic noon. Conversely, JWST-EROs have a significantly higher fraction of those with blue excess than DOGs. We present the average UV spectra of BluDOGs as a comparison to JWST-EROs and discuss a coherent evolutionary scenario for dusty AGN populations.}},

The sample of 22 quasars from the Subaru High-z Exploration of Low- Luminosity Quasars (SHELLQs) project, combined with 13 brighter quasars in the literature, covers an unprecedentedly wide range of rest-frame ultraviolet magnitudes over -28 < M $\_{1450}$ < -23. We found that the binned LF flattens significantly toward the faint end populated by the SHELLQs quasars. A maximum likelihood fit to a double power-law model has a break magnitude ${M}\_{1450}^{* }=-{25.60}\_{-0.30}^{+0.40}$ , a characteristic density ${{\rm{\Phi }}}^{* }={1.35}\_{-0.30}^{+0.47}$ Gpc$^{-3}$ mag$^{-1}$, and a bright-end slope $\beta =-{3.34}\_{-0.57}^{+0.49}$ , when the faint-end slope is fixed to {\ensuremath{\alpha}} = -1.2 as observed at z {\ensuremath{\leq}} 6. The overall LF shape remains remarkably similar from z = 4 to 7, while the amplitude decreases substantially toward higher redshifts, with a clear indication of an accelerating decline at z {\ensuremath{\geq}} 6. The estimated ionizing photon density, 10$^{48.2{\ensuremath{\pm}}0.1}$ s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-3}$, is less than 1\% of the critical rate to keep the intergalactic medium ionized at z = 7, and thus indicates that quasars are not a major contributor to cosmic reionization.}},

We homogeneously reduce the new JWST data and combine them with existing observations from the Hubble Space Telescope. We select a robust sample of \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde80 candidate quiescent and quenching galaxies at 3 < z < 5 using two methods: (1) based on their rest-frame UVJ colors, and (2) a novel quantitative approach based on Gaussian mixture modeling of the near-UV - U, U - V, and V - J rest-frame color space, which is more sensitive to recently quenched objects. We measure comoving number densities of massive (M $\_{{\ensuremath{\star}}}$ {\ensuremath{\geq}} 10$^{10.6}$ M $\_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$) quiescent galaxies consistent with previous estimates relying on ground-based observations, after homogenizing the results in the literature with our mass and redshift intervals. However, we find significant field-to-field variations of the number densities up to a factor of 2-3, highlighting the effect of cosmic variance and suggesting the presence of overdensities of red quiescent galaxies at z > 3, as could be expected for highly clustered massive systems. Importantly, JWST enables the robust identification of quenching/quiescent galaxy candidates at lower masses and higher redshifts than before, challenging standard formation scenarios. All data products, including the literature compilation, are made publicly available.}},

Executed in 2023 November, MegaScience obtained {\ensuremath{\sim}}30 arcmin$^{2}$ of deep multiband NIRCam imaging centered on the z {\ensuremath{\sim}} 0.3 A2744 cluster, including 11 medium-band filters and the two shortest-wavelength broadband filters, F070W and F090W. Together, MegaScience and the UNCOVER Cycle 1 treasury program provide a complete set of deep ({\ensuremath{\sim}}28{\textendash}30 mag$\_{AB}$) images in all NIRCam medium- and broadband filters. This unique data set allows us to precisely constrain photometric redshifts, map stellar populations and dust attenuation for large samples of distant galaxies, and examine the connection between galaxy structures and formation histories. MegaScience also includes {\ensuremath{\sim}}17 arcmin$^{2}$ of NIRISS parallel imaging in two broadband and four medium-band filters from 0.9 to 4.8 {\ensuremath{\mu}}m, expanding the footprint where robust spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting is possible. We provide example SEDs and multiband cutouts at a variety of redshifts, and use a catalog of JWST spectroscopic redshifts to show that MegaScience improves both the scatter and catastrophic outlier rate of photometric redshifts by factors of 2{\textendash}3. Additionally, we demonstrate the spatially resolved science enabled by MegaScience by presenting maps of the [O III] line emission and continuum emission in three spectroscopically confirmed z > 6 galaxies. We show that line emission in reionization-era galaxies can be clumpy, extended, and spatially offset from continuum emission, implying that galaxy assembly histories are complex even at these early epochs. We publicly release fully reduced mosaics and photometric catalogs for both the NIRCam primary and NIRISS parallel fields (jwst-uncover.github.io/megascience).}},

In this context, a relevant finding has been the large fraction of candidate dual AGN, both at large separations (several kpc) and in close pairs (less than a kpc), likely in the process of merging. Frequent black hole merging may be a route for black hole growth in the early universe; however, previous findings are still tentative and indirect.

This BLR is offset by 620 pc in projection from the centroid of strong rest-frame optical emission, with a velocity offset of \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde40 km s$^{-1}$. The latter region is also characterized by (narrow) nebular emission features typical of AGN, hence also likely hosting another accreting black hole, although obscured (Type 2, narrow-line AGN). We exclude that the offset BLR is associated with Supernovae or massive stars, and we interpret these results as two black holes in the process of merging. This finding may be relevant for estimates of the rate and properties of gravitational-wave signals from the early universe that will be detected by future observatories like LISA.}},

Data from the Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) on board the James Webb Space Telescope provides an excellent opportunity to perform such studies. We take advantage of the MIRI imaging data from the Cosmic Evolution Early Release Science Survey to investigate the AGN population in the distant universe. We estimate the source properties of MIRI-selected objects by utilizing spectral energy distribution (SED) modeling, and classify them into star-forming galaxies (SFs), SF-AGN mixed objects, and AGN. The source numbers of these types are 433, 102, and 25, respectively, from four MIRI pointings covering \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde9 arcmin$^{2}$. The sample spans a redshift range of {\ensuremath{\approx}}0-5. We derive the median SEDs for all three source types, respectively, and publicly release them. The median MIRI SED of AGN is similar to the typical SEDs of hot dust-obscured galaxies and Seyfert 2s, for which the mid-IR SEDs are dominated by emission from AGN-heated hot dust. Based on our SED-fit results, we estimate the black hole accretion density (BHAD; i.e., total BH growth rate per comoving volume) as a function of redshift. At z < 3, the resulting BHAD agrees with the X-ray measurements in general. At z > 3, we identify a total of 27 AGN and SF-AGN mixed objects, leading to that our high-z BHAD is substantially higher than the X-ray results (\raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde0.5 dex at z {\ensuremath{\approx}} 3-5). This difference indicates MIRI can identify a large population of heavily obscured AGN missed by X-ray surveys at high redshifts.}},

    abstract = {{The detection of starlight from the host galaxies of quasars during the reionization epoch (z > 6) has been elusive, even with deep Hubble Space Telescope observations$^{1,2}$. The current highest redshift quasar host detected$^{3}$, at z = 4.5, required the magnifying effect of a foreground lensing galaxy. Low-luminosity quasars$^{4-6}$ from the Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program (HSC-SSP)$^{7}$ mitigate the challenge of detecting their underlying, previously undetected host galaxies. Here we report rest-frame optical images and spectroscopy of two HSC-SSP quasars at z > 6 with the JWST. Using near-infrared camera imaging at 3.6 and 1.5 {\ensuremath{\mu}}m and subtracting the light from the unresolved quasars, we find that the host galaxies are massive (stellar masses of 13 {\texttimes} and 3.4 {\texttimes} {}10$^{10}$ M$\_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$, respectively), compact and disc-like. Near-infrared spectroscopy at medium resolution shows stellar absorption lines in the more massive quasar, confirming the detection of the host. Velocity- broadened gas in the vicinity of these quasars enables measurements of their black hole masses (1.4 {\texttimes} {}10$^{9}$ and 2.0 {\texttimes} {}10$^{8}$ M$\_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$, respectively). Their location in the black hole mass-stellar mass plane is consistent with the distribution at low redshift, suggesting that the relation between black holes and their host galaxies was already in place less than a billion years after the Big Bang.}},

The spectral coverage and the depth of our observations allowed us to select narrow-line AGN based on both rest-frame optical and UV emission lines up to z = 10. Due to the metallicity decrease of galaxies, at z > 3, the standard optical diagnostic diagrams (N2-BPT or S2-VO87) become unable to distinguish many AGN from other sources of photoionisation. Therefore, we also used high ionisation lines, such as He II{\ensuremath{\lambda}}4686, He II{\ensuremath{\lambda}}1640, [Ne IV] {\ensuremath{\lambda}}2422, [Ne V] {\ensuremath{\lambda}}3420, and N V {\ensuremath{\lambda}}1240, also in combination with other UV transitions, to trace the presence of AGN. Out of a parent sample of 209 galaxies, we identified 42 type-2 AGN (although ten of them are tentative), making the fraction of galaxies in JADES hosting type-2 AGN about 20 {\ensuremath{\pm}} 5\%, which does not evolve significantly in the redshift range between 2 and 10. The selected type-2 AGN have estimated bolometric luminosities of 10$^{41.3 ‑ 44.9}$ erg s$^{‑1}$ and host-galaxy stellar masses of 10$^{7.2 ‑ 9.3}$ M$\_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$. The star formation rates of the selected AGN host galaxies are consistent with those of the star-forming main sequence.

The novel observing strategy of RUBIES offers a well-quantified selection function. The survey has been optimised to reach high (>70\%) spectroscopic completeness for bright and red (F150W‑F444W>2) sources that are very rare. To place these rare sources in context, we simultaneously observed a reference sample of the 2<z<7 galaxy population, sampling sources at a rate that is inversely proportional to their number density in the 3D parameter space of F444W magnitude, F150W‑F444W colour, and photometric redshift. In total, RUBIES observed {\ensuremath{\sim}}3000 targets across 1<z$\_{phot}$<10 with both the PRISM and G395M dispersers and {\ensuremath{\sim}}1500 targets at z$\_{phot}$>3 using only the G395M disperser. The RUBIES data reveal a highly diverse population of red sources that span a broad redshift range (z$\_{spec}${\ensuremath{\sim}}1‑9), with photometric redshift scatter and an outlier fraction that are three times higher than for similarly bright sources that are less red. This diversity is not apparent from the photometric spectral energy distributions (SEDs). Only spectroscopy reveals that the SEDs encompass a mixture of galaxies with dust-obscured star formation, extreme line emission, a lack of star formation indicating early quenching, and luminous active galactic nuclei. As a first demonstration of our broader selection function we compared the stellar masses and rest-frame U‑V colours of the red sources and our reference sample. We find that the red sources are typically more massive (M$\_{*}${\ensuremath{\sim}}10$^{10‑11.5}$ M$\_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$) across all redshifts. However, we also find that the most massive systems span a wide range in U‑V colour. We describe our data reduction procedure and data quality, and we publicly release the reduced RUBIES data and vetted spectroscopic redshifts of the first half of the survey through the DAWN JWST Archive.}},

The survey also includes measurements at 95 and 220 GHz, which have noise levels a factor of {\ensuremath{\sim}}1.2 and 3.5 times higher than 150 GHz, respectively, with each band having a polarization noise level <inline-formula> <mml:math overflow=``s croll''><mml:mo>{\ensuremath{\sim}}</mml:mo><mml:msqrt><mml:mrow ><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msqrt></mml:math> </inline- formula> times higher than the temperature noise. We use a novel approach to obtain the covariance matrices for jointly and optimally estimated gravitational lensing potential band powers and unlensed CMB temperature and polarization band powers. We demonstrate the ability to test the {\ensuremath{\Lambda}}CDM model via the consistency of cosmological parameters constrained independently from SPT-3G and Planck data, and consider the improvement in constraints on {\ensuremath{\Lambda}}CDM extension parameters from a joint analysis of SPT-3G and Planck data. The {\ensuremath{\Lambda}}CDM cosmological parameters are typically constrained with uncertainties up to {\ensuremath{\sim}}2 times smaller with SPT-3G data, compared to Planck, with the two data sets measuring significantly different angular scales and polarization levels, providing additional tests of the standard cosmological model.}},

    abstract = {{The James Webb Space Telescope is revolutionizing our view of the Universe through unprecedented sensitivity and resolution in the infrared, with some of the largest gains realized at its longest wavelengths. We present the Systematic Mid-infrared Instrument (MIRI) Legacy Extragalactic Survey (SMILES), an eight-band MIRI survey with Near-Infrared Spectrograph spectroscopic follow-up in the GOODS-S/HUDF region. SMILES takes full advantage of MIRI's continuous coverage from 5.6 to 25.5 {\ensuremath{\mu}}m over an {\ensuremath{\sim}}34 arcmin$^{2}$ area to greatly expand our understanding of the obscured Universe up to cosmic noon and beyond. This work, together with a companion paper by G. Rieke et al., covers the SMILES science drivers and technical design, early results with SMILES, data reduction, photometric catalog creation, and the first data release. As part of the discussion on early results, we additionally present a high- level science demonstration on how MIRI's wavelength coverage and resolution will advance our understanding of cosmic dust using the full range of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon emission features from 3.3 to 18 {\ensuremath{\mu}}m. Using custom background subtraction, we produce robust reductions of the MIRI imaging that maximize the depths reached with our modest exposure times ({\ensuremath{\sim}}0.6‑2.2 ks per filter). Included in our initial data release are (1) eight MIRI imaging mosaics reaching depths of 0.2‑18 {\ensuremath{\mu}}Jy (5{\ensuremath{\sigma}}) and (2) a 5‑25.5 {\ensuremath{\mu}}m photometric catalog with over 3000 sources. Building upon the rich legacy of extensive photometric and spectroscopy coverage of GOODS-S/HUDF from the X-ray to the radio, SMILES greatly expands our investigative power in understanding the obscured Universe.}},

Comparing the stellar mass $M\_*$ and the UV-slope $\beta$ distributions between JWST- and HST-selected samples, we generally find very good agreement and no significant biases. Nevertheless, JWST enables us to probe a new population of UV-red galaxies that was missing from previous HST-based Lyman-break galaxy (LBG) samples. We measure galaxy stellar mass functions (SMFs) at $z\sim 4\!-\!9$ down to limiting masses of $10^{7.5}\!-\!10^{8.5}\, {\rm M\_\odot }$, finding steep low-mass slopes over the entire redshift range, reaching values of $\alpha \approx -2$ at $zrsim 6$. At the high-mass end, UV-red galaxies dominate at least out to $z\sim 6$. The implied redshift evolution of the SMF suggests a rapid build-up of massive dust-obscured or quiescent galaxies from $z\sim 6$ to $z\sim 4$ as well as an enhanced efficiency of star formation towards earlier times ($zrsim 6$). Finally, we show that the galaxy mass density grows by a factor $\sim 20\times$ from $z\sim 9$ to $z\sim 4$. Our results emphasize the importance of rest-frame optically selected samples in inferring accurate distributions of physical properties and studying the mass build-up of galaxies in the first 1.5 Gyr of cosmic history.}},

The Chandra X-ray source detected in UHZ1 is a Compton-thick quasar with a bolometric luminosity of L $\_{bol}$ \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde 5 {\texttimes} {}10$^{45}$ erg s$^{-1}$, which corresponds to an estimated black hole (BH) mass of \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde4 {\texttimes} {}10$^{7}$ M $\_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$, assuming accretion at the Eddington rate. JWST NIRCAM and NIRSpec data yield a stellar mass estimate for UHZ1 comparable to its BH mass. These characteristics are in excellent agreement with prior theoretical predictions for a unique class of transient, high-redshift objects, overmassive black hole galaxies (OBGs) by Natarajan et al., that harbor a heavy initial black hole seed that likely formed from the direct collapse of the gas. Given the excellent agreement between the observed multiwavelength properties of UHZ1 and theoretical model template predictions, we suggest that UHZ1 is the first detected OBG candidate. Our assertion rests on multiple lines of concordant evidence between model predictions and the following observed properties of UHZ1: its X-ray detection and the estimated ratio of the X-ray flux to the IR flux, which is consistent with theoretical expectations for a heavy initial BH seed; its high measured redshift of z {\ensuremath{\approx}} 10.1, as predicted for the transient OBG stage (9 < z < 12); the amplitude and shape of the detected JWST spectral energy distribution (SED) between 1 and 5 {\ensuremath{\mu}}m, which is in very good agreement with simulated template SEDs for OBGs; and the extended JWST morphology of UHZ1, which is suggestive of a recent merge and is also expected for the formation of transient OBGs. As the first OBG candidate, UHZ1 provides compelling evidence for the formation of heavy initial seeds from direct collapse in the early Universe.}},

Three prominent galaxy overdensities are observed, one of them at the redshift of the quasar. Galaxies are found within 200 pkpc and 105 km s$^{-1}$ of four known metal absorption-line systems. We focus on the role of the galaxies in ionizing the intergalactic medium (IGM) during the later stages of cosmic reionization and construct the mean Ly{\ensuremath{\alpha}} and Ly{\ensuremath{\beta}} transmission as a function of distance from the galaxies. At the lowest redshifts in our study, 5.3 < z < 5.7, the IGM transmission rises monotonically with distance from the galaxies, as seen previously at lower redshifts. In contrast, at 5.7 < z < 6.14, the transmission of both Ly{\ensuremath{\alpha}} and Ly{\ensuremath{\beta}} first increases with distance but then peaks at a distance of 5 cMpc before declining. Finally, in the region 6.15 < z < 6.26, where the additional ionizing radiation from the quasar dominates, the monotonic increase in transmission with distance is reestablished. This result is interpreted to represent evidence that the transmission of the IGM at z \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde 5.9 toward J0100+2802 results from the ``local'' ionizing radiation of galaxies that dominates over the much-reduced cosmic background.}},

The high number densities reported, together with the large Lyman-continuum (LyC) production efficiency and leakiness into the intergalactic medium that are typical of UV-selected AGNs, lead us to reassess a scenario where AGNs are the sole drivers of the cosmic hydrogen/helium reionization process.

The high-redshift galaxy candidates were selected from their estimated photometric redshifts calculated using a template-fitting approach, followed by visual inspection from seven independent reviewers. We explore these candidates in detail, highlighting interesting resolved or extended sources, sources with very red long- wavelength slopes, and our highest-redshift candidates, which extend to z $\_{phot}$ {\ensuremath{\sim}} 18. Over 93\% of the sources are newly identified from our deep JADES imaging, including 31 new galaxy candidates at z $\_{phot}$ > 12. We also investigate potential contamination by stellar objects, and do not find strong evidence from spectral energy distribution fitting that these faint high-redshift galaxy candidates are low-mass stars. Using 42 sources in our sample with measured spectroscopic redshifts from NIRSpec and FRESCO, we find excellent agreement to our photometric redshift estimates, with no catastrophic outliers and an average difference of <{\ensuremath{\Delta}}z = z $\_{phot}$ ‑ z $\_{spec}$> = 0.26.

The first JWST data are now being taken over several extragalactic fields to different depths and across various areas, which will be ideal for the discovery and classification of galaxies out to distances previously uncharted. As spectroscopic redshift measurements for sources in this epoch will not be initially available to compare with the first photometric measurements of z > 8 galaxies, robust photometric redshifts are of the utmost importance. Galaxies at z > 8 are expected to have bluer rest-frame ultraviolet (UV) colors than typically used model SED templates, which could lead to catastrophic photometric redshift failures. We use a combination of BPASS and CLOUDY models to create a supporting set of templates that match the predicted rest-UV colors of z > 8 simulated galaxies. We test these new templates by fitting simulated galaxies in a mock catalog, Yung et al., which mimic expected field depths and areas of the JWST Cosmic Evolution Early Release Science Survey (m $\_{5{\ensuremath{\sigma}} }$ \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde 28.6 over \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde100 arcmin$^{2}$).

    abstract = {{We study the early growth of massive seed black holes (BHs) via accretion in protogalactic nuclei where the stellar bulge component is assembled, performing axisymmetric two-dimensional radiation hydrodynamical simulations. We find that when a seed BH with M $\_{{\textbullet}}$ \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde {}10$^{5}$ M $\_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$ is embedded in dense metal-poor gas (Z = 0.01 Z $\_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$) with a density of {\ensuremath{\gtrsim}} 100 cm$^{-3}$ and bulge stars with a total mass of M $\_{{\ensuremath{\star}}}$ {\ensuremath{\gtrsim}} 100 M $\_{{\textbullet}}$, a massive gaseous disk feeds the BH efficiently at rates of {\ensuremath{\gtrsim}} 0.3-1 M $\_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$ yr$^{-1}$, and the BH mass increases nearly tenfold within \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde2 Myr. This rapid accretion phase lasts until a good fraction of the gas bounded within the bulge accretes onto the BH, although the feeding rate is regulated owing to strong outflows driven by ionizing radiation emitted from the accreting BH. The transient growing mode can be triggered for seed BHs formed in massive dark-matter halos with masses of {\ensuremath{\gtrsim}} {}10$^{9}$ M $\_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$ at z \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde 15-20 (the virial temperature is T $\_{vir}$ ≃ {}10$^{5}$ K). The host halos are heavier and rarer than those of typical first galaxies, but are more likely to end up in quasar hosts by z ≃ 6. This mechanism naturally yields a mass ratio of M $\_{{\textbullet}}$/M $\_{{\ensuremath{\star}}}$ > 0.01 higher than the value seen in the local universe. The existence of such overmassive BHs provides us with a unique opportunity to detect highly accreting seed BHs at z \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde 15 with AB magnitude of m $\_{AB}$ \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde 26-29 mag at 2 {\ensuremath{\mu}}m (rest frame 10 eV) by the upcoming observations by the James Webb Space Telescope and Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope.}},

    abstract = {{JWST observations indicate a surprising excess of luminous galaxies at z \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde 10 and above, consistent with efficient conversion of the accreted gas into stars, unlike the suppression of star formation by feedback at later times. We show that the high densities and low metallicities at this epoch guarantee a high star formation efficiency (SFE) in the most massive dark-matter haloes. Feedback-free starbursts (FFBs) occur when the free-fall time is shorter than \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde$1\, {\rm Myr}$, below the time for low-metallicity massive stars to develop winds and supernovae. This corresponds to a characteristic density of \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde$3\!\times \!10^3\, {\rm cm}^{-3}$. A comparable threshold density permits a starburst by allowing cooling to star-forming temperatures in a free-fall time. The galaxies within \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde{}10$^{11}$ M$\_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$ haloes at z \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde 10 are expected to have FFB densities. The halo masses allow efficient gas supply by cold streams in a halo crossing time \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde$80\, {\rm Myr}$. The FFBs gradually turn all the accreted gas into stars in clusters of \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde10$^{4-7}$ M$\_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$ within galaxies that are rotating discs or shells. The starbursting clouds are insensitive to radiative feedback and are shielded against feedback from earlier stars. We predict high SFE above thresholds in redshift and halo mass, where the density is $10^{3\!-\!4}\, {\rm cm}^{-3}$. The z \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde 10 haloes of \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde10$^{10.8}$ M$\_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$ are predicted to host galaxies of \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde{}10$^{10}$ M$\_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$ with star formation rate \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde$65\,\mathrm{ M}\_\odot \, {\rm yr}^{-1}$, blue colours, and sub-kpc sizes. The metallicity is {\ensuremath{\leq}}0.1 Z$\_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$ with little dust, gas, outflows, and hot circumgalactic gas, allowing a top- heavy initial mass function but not requiring it. The compact galaxies with thousands of young FFB clusters may have implications on reionization, black hole growth, and globular clusters.}},

    abstract = {{JWST observations have unveiled faint active galactic nuclei (AGNs) at high redshift that provide insights into the formation of supermassive black holes (SMBHs). However, disentangling their stellar from AGN light is challenging. Here, we use an empirical approach to infer the average stellar mass of five faint broad- line (BL) H{\ensuremath{\alpha}} emitters at z = 4{\textendash}5 with BH masses {\ensuremath{\approx}}6 {\texttimes} {}10$^{6}$ M$\_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$, with a method independent of their spectral energy distribution (SED). We use the deep JWST/NIRcam grism survey ``All the Little Things'' to measure the overdensities around BL-H{\ensuremath{\alpha}} emitters and around a spectroscopic reference sample of {\ensuremath{\sim}}300 galaxies. In our reference sample, we find that megaparsec-scale overdensity correlates with stellar mass. Their large-scale environments suggest that BL-H{\ensuremath{\alpha}} emitters are hosted by galaxies with stellar masses {\ensuremath{\approx}}5 {\texttimes} {}10$^{7}$ M$\_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$, {\ensuremath{\approx}}40 times lower than those inferred from galaxy-only SED fits. Adding measurements around more luminous z {\ensuremath{\approx}} 6 AGNs, we find tentative correlations between line width, BH mass, and the overdensity, suggestive of a steep BH to halo mass relation. The main implications are (1) when BH masses are taken at face value, we confirm extremely high BH to stellar mass ratios of {\ensuremath{\approx}}10\%, (2) the galaxies of low stellar mass that host growing SMBHs are in tension with typical hydrodynamical simulations, except those without feedback, (3) a 1\% duty cycle implied by the host mass hints at super-Eddington accretion, (4) the masses are at odds with an interpretation of the line broadening in terms of high stellar density, (5) our results imply a luminosity-dependent diversity of galaxy masses, environments, and SEDs among AGN samples.}},

    abstract = {{While supermassive black holes (SMBHs) are widely observed in the nearby and distant Universe, their origin remains debated with two viable formation scenarios with light and heavy seeds. In the light seeding model, the seed of the first SMBHs form from the collapse of massive stars with masses of 10{\textendash}100 M $\_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$, while the heavy seeding model posits the formation of 10$^{4{\textendash}5}$ M $\_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$ seeds from direct collapse. The detection of SMBHs at redshifts z {\ensuremath{\gtrsim}} 10, edging closer to their formation epoch, provides critical observational discrimination between these scenarios. Here, we focus on the JWST-detected galaxy, GHZ 9, at z {\ensuremath{\approx}} 10 that is lensed by the foreground cluster, A2744. Based on 2.1 Ms deep Chandra observations, we detect a candidate X-ray active galactic nucleus (AGN), which is spatially coincident with the high-redshift galaxy, GHZ 9. The SMBH candidate is inferred to have a bolometric luminosity of $({1.0}\_{-0.4}^{+0.5})\times {10}^{46}\ \mathrm{erg}\,{{\rm{s}}}^{-1}$ , which corresponds to a black hole (BH) mass of $({8.0}\_{-3.2}^{+3.7})\times {10}^{7}\ {M}\_{\odot }$ assuming Eddington-limited accretion. This extreme mass at such an early cosmic epoch suggests the heavy seed origin for this BH candidate. Based on the Chandra and JWST discoveries of extremely high-redshift quasars, we have constructed the first simple AGN luminosity function extending to z {\ensuremath{\approx}} 10. Comparison of this luminosity function with theoretical models indicates an overabundant z {\ensuremath{\approx}} 10 SMBH population, consistent with a higher-than-expected seed formation efficiency.}},

    abstract = {{Cold, substellar objects such as brown dwarfs have long been recognized as contaminants in color-selected samples of active galactic nuclei (AGNs). In particular, their near- to mid-infrared colors (1-5 {\ensuremath{\mu}}m) can closely resemble the V-shaped (f $\_{ {\ensuremath{\lambda}} }$) spectra of highly reddened accreting supermassive black holes (``little red dots''), especially at 6 < z < 7. Recently, a NIRCam-selected sample of little red dots over 45 arcmin$^{2}$ has been followed up with deep NIRSpec multiobject prism spectroscopy through the UNCOVER program. By investigating the acquired spectra, we identify 3 of the 14 followed-up objects as T/Y dwarfs with temperatures between 650 and 1300 K and distances between 0.8 and 4.8 kpc. At ${4.8}\_{-0.1}^{+0.6}$ kpc, A2744-BD1 is the most distant brown dwarf discovered to date. We identify the remaining 11 objects as extragalactic sources at z $\_{spec}$ {\ensuremath{\gtrsim}} 5. Given that three of these sources are strongly lensed images of the same AGN (A2744-QSO1), we derive a brown dwarf contamination fraction of 25\% in this NIRCam selection of little red dots. We find that in the near-infrared filters, brown dwarfs appear much bluer than the highly reddened AGN, providing an avenue for distinguishing the two and compiling cleaner samples of photometrically selected highly reddened AGN.}},
