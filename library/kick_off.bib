Despite the widespread presence of AGN signatures in their rest-optical and -ultraviolet spectra, the vast majority of them is X-ray undetected. The stacked X-ray data of the non- detected sources also results in a non-detection. The upper limit on the X-ray emission for many of these AGN is one or even two orders of magnitude lower than expected from a standard AGN Spectral Energy Distribution (SED). X-ray absorption by clouds with large (Compton-thick) column density and low dust content, such as the broad-line region (BLR) clouds, can explain the X-ray weakness. In this scenario, the BLR covering factor should be much larger than in low-z AGN or luminous quasars; this is supported by the larger equivalent width of the broad component of H<inline-formula><tex-math id=``TM0003'' notation=``LaTeX''>$\alpha$</tex-math></inline-formula> in JWST- selected AGN. We also find that the JWST-discovered AGN lack prominent, fast outflows, suggesting that, in JWST-selected AGN, dense gas lingers in the nuclear region, resulting in large covering factors. We also note that a large fraction of JWST- selected AGN matches the definition of narrow-line Seyfert 1, typically accreting at high rates and characterized by a steep X-ray spectrum - this can further contribute to their observed weakness at high-z. Finally, we discuss that the broad Balmer lines used to identify type 1 AGN cannot be ascribed to very massive stars or supernovae, although we show that some of the faintest broad lines could potentially be associated with superluminous SNe.}},

We describe the observations, data reduction, sample selection, and target allocation. We measured 2375 redshifts (2053 from multiple emission lines); our targets span the range from z = 0.5 up to z = 13, including 404 at z > 5. The data release includes 2D and 1D fully reduced spectra, with slit-loss corrections and background subtraction optimized for point sources. We also provide redshifts and signal-to-noise ratio > 5 emission-line flux catalogs for the prism and grating spectra, and concise guidelines on how to use these data products. Alongside spectroscopy, we are also publishing fully calibrated NIRCam imaging, which enables studying the JADES sample with the combined power of imaging and spectroscopy. Together, these data provide the largest statistical sample to date to characterize the properties of galaxy populations in the first billion years after the Big Bang.}},

    abstract = {{Within the established framework of structure formation, galaxies start as systems of low stellar mass and gradually grow into far more massive galaxies. The existence of massive galaxies in the first billion years of the Universe, as suggested by recent observations, seems to challenge this model, as such galaxies would require highly efficient conversion of baryons into stars. An even greater challenge in this epoch is the existence of massive galaxies that have already ceased forming stars. However, robust detections of early massive quiescent galaxies have been challenging due to the coarse wavelength sampling of photometric surveys. Here we report the spectroscopic confirmation with the James Webb Space Telescope of the quiescent galaxy RUBIES-EGS-QG-1 at redshift z = 4.90, 1.2 billion years after the Big Bang. Deep stellar absorption features in the spectrum reveal that the stellar mass of the galaxy of {}10$^{11}$ M$\_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$ formed in a short 200 Myr burst of star formation, after which star formation activity dropped rapidly and persistently. According to current galaxy formation models, systems with such rapid stellar mass growth and early quenching are too rare to plausibly occur in the small area probed spectroscopically with JWST. Instead, the discovery of RUBIES-EGS-QG-1 implies that early massive quiescent galaxies can be quenched earlier or exhaust gas available for star formation more efficiently than assumed at present.}},

Several different models have been proposed to explain these findings, ranging from heavy seeds to light seeds experiencing bursts of high accretion rate$^{10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15{\textendash}16}$. Yet, current datasets are unable to differentiate between these various scenarios. Here we report the detection, from the JADES survey, of broad H{\ensuremath{\alpha}} emission in a galaxy at z = 6.68, which traces a black hole with a mass of about 4 {\texttimes} {}10$^{8}$M$\_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$ and accreting at a rate of only 0.02 times the Eddington limit. The black hole to host galaxy stellar mass ratio is about 0.4{\textemdash}that is, about 1,000 times above the local relation{\textemdash}whereas the system is closer to the local relations in terms of dynamical mass and velocity dispersion of the host galaxy. This object is most likely an indication of a much larger population of dormant black holes around the epoch of reionization. Its properties are consistent with scenarios in which short bursts of super-Eddington accretion have resulted in black hole overgrowth and massive gas expulsion from the accretion disk; in between bursts, black holes spend most of their life in a dormant state.}},

This finding suggests that part of the X-ray weakness is due to high (Compton-thick) X-ray absorption by clouds in the BLR, or in its outer regions. GN-28074 is also extremely radio-weak. The radio weakness can also be explained in terms of absorption, as the inferred density of the BLR clouds makes them attenuate the radio emission through free-free absorption. Alternatively, the nuclear magnetic field may be underdeveloped, resulting both in intrinsically weak radio emission and lack of hot corona, hence intrinsic X-ray weakness.

    abstract = {{Spectroscopy with the James Webb Space Telescope has opened the possibility of identifying moderate-luminosity active galactic nuclei (AGNs) in the early Universe, at and beyond the epoch of re-ionisation, complementing previous surveys of much more luminous (and much rarer) quasars. We present 12 new AGNs at 4 < z < 7 in the JADES survey (in addition to the previously identified AGN in GN-z11 at z = 10.6) revealed through the detection of a broad-line region (BLR) seen in the Balmer emission lines. The depth of JADES, together with the use of three different spectral resolutions, enables us to probe a lower-mass regime relative to previous studies. In a few cases, we find evidence for two broad components of H{\ensuremath{\alpha}}, which suggests that these could be candidate merging black holes (BHs), although a complex BLR geometry cannot be excluded. The inferred BH masses range from 8 {\texttimes} {}10$^{7}$ M$\_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$ down to 4 {\texttimes} {}10$^{5}$ M$\_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$, interestingly probing the regime expected for direct collapse BHs. The inferred AGN bolometric luminosities ({\ensuremath{\sim}}{}10$^{44}$ ‑ {}10$^{45}$ erg/s) imply accretion rates that are < 0.5 times the Eddington rate in most cases. However, small BHs, with M$\_{BH}$ {\ensuremath{\sim}} {}10$^{6}$ M$\_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$, tend to accrete at Eddington or super-Eddington rates. These BHs at z {\ensuremath{\sim}} 4{\textendash}11 are over-massive relative to their host galaxies' stellar masses when compared to the local M$\_{BH}$ ‑ M$\_{star}$ relation, even approaching M$\_{BH}$ {\ensuremath{\sim}} M$\_{star}$, as was expected from heavy BH seeds and/or super-Eddington accretion scenarios. However, we find that these early BHs tend to be more consistent with the local relation between M$\_{BH}$ and velocity dispersion, as well as between M$\_{BH}$ and dynamical mass, suggesting that these are more fundamental and universal relations. On the classical, optical narrow-line excitation-diagnostic diagrams, these AGNs are located in the region that is locally occupied by star- forming galaxies, implying that they would be missed by the standard classification techniques if they did not display broad lines. Their location on the diagram is consistent with what is expected for AGNs hosted in metal-poor galaxies (Z {\ensuremath{\sim}} 0.1 ‑ 0.2 Z$\_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$). The fraction of broad-line AGNs with L$\_{AGN}$ > {}10$^{44}$ erg/s among galaxies in the redshift range of 4 < z < 6 is about 10\%, suggesting that the contribution of AGNs and their hosts to the re-ionisation of the Universe is > 10\%.}},

    abstract = {{The identification of red, apparently massive galaxies at z > 7 in early James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) photometry suggests a strongly accelerated time line compared to standard models of galaxy growth. A major uncertainty in the interpretation is whether the red colors are caused by evolved stellar populations, dust, or other effects such as emission lines or active galactic nuclei (AGNs). Here we show that three of the massive galaxy candidates at z = 6.7{\textendash}8.4 have prominent Balmer breaks in JWST/NIRSpec spectroscopy from the RUBIES program. The Balmer breaks demonstrate unambiguously that stellar emission dominates at {\ensuremath{\lambda}} $\_{rest}$ = 0.4 {\ensuremath{\mu}}m and require formation histories extending hundreds of millions of years into the past in galaxies only 600{\textendash}800 Myr after the big bang. Two of the three galaxies also show broad Balmer lines, with H{\ensuremath{\beta}} FWHM > 2500 km s$^{‑1}$, suggesting that dust-reddened AGNs contribute to, or even dominate, the spectral energy distributions of these galaxies at {\ensuremath{\lambda}} $\_{rest}$ {\ensuremath{\gtrsim}} 0.6 {\ensuremath{\mu}}m. All three galaxies have relatively narrow [O III] lines, seemingly ruling out a high-mass interpretation if the lines arise in dynamically relaxed, inclined disks. Yet the inferred masses also remain highly uncertain. We model the high-quality spectra using Prospector to decompose the continuum into stellar and AGN components and explore limiting cases in stellar/AGN contribution. This produces a wide range of possible stellar masses, spanning M $\_{{\ensuremath{\star}}}$ {\ensuremath{\sim}} {}10$^{9}$‑{}10$^{11}$ M $\_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$. Nevertheless, all fits suggest a very early and rapid formation, most of which follow with a truncation in star formation. Potential origins and evolutionary tracks for these objects are discussed, from the cores of massive galaxies to low-mass galaxies with overmassive black holes. Intriguingly, we find all of these explanations to be incomplete; deeper and redder data are needed to understand the physics of these systems.}},

We report significant progress with JWST toward this goal from the Systematic Mid-infrared Instrument Legacy Extragalactic Survey (SMILES). Based on comprehensive spectral energy distribution (SED) analysis of 3273 MIRI-detected sources, we identify 217 AGN candidates over a survey area of {\ensuremath{\sim}}34 arcmin$^{2}$, including a primary sample of 111 AGNs in normal massive galaxies (M $\_{*}$ > 10$^{9.5}$ M $\_{☉}$) at z {\ensuremath{\sim}} 0{\textendash}4, an extended sample of 86 AGN candidates in low-mass galaxies (M $\_{*}$ < 10$^{9.5}$ M $\_{☉}$), and a high-z sample of 20 AGN candidates at z {\ensuremath{\sim}} 4{\textendash}8.4. Notably, about 80\% of our MIRI-selected AGN candidates are new discoveries despite the extensive pre-JWST AGN searches. Even among the massive galaxies where the previous AGN search is believed to be thorough, 34\% of the MIRI AGN identifications are new, highlighting the impact of obscuration on previous selections. By combining our results with the efforts at other wavelengths, we build the most complete AGN sample to date and examine the relative performance of different selection techniques. We find the obscured AGN fraction increases from L $\_{AGN,bol}$ {\ensuremath{\sim}} {}10$^{10}$ L $\_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$ to {}10$^{11}$ L $\_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$ and then drops toward higher luminosity. Additionally, the obscured AGN fraction gradually increases from z {\ensuremath{\sim}} 0 to z {\ensuremath{\sim}} 4 with most high-z AGNs obscured. We discuss how AGN obscuration, intrinsic SED variations, galaxy contamination, survey depth, and selection techniques complicate the construction of a complete AGN sample.}},

    abstract = {{Early JWST observations have uncovered a population of red sources that might represent a previously overlooked phase of supermassive black hole growth$^{1-3}$. One of the most intriguing examples is an extremely red, point-like object that was found to be triply imaged by the strong lensing cluster Abell 2744 (ref. $^{4}$). Here we present deep JWST/NIRSpec observations of this object, Abell2744-QSO1. The spectroscopy confirms that the three images are of the same object, and that it is a highly reddened (A$\_{V}$ ≃ 3) broad emission line active galactic nucleus at a redshift of z$\_{spec}$ = 7.0451 {\ensuremath{\pm}} 0.0005. From the width of H{\ensuremath{\beta}} (full width at half-maximum = 2,800 {\ensuremath{\pm}} 250 km s$^{{\ensuremath{-}}1}$), we derive a black hole mass of M$\_{BH}$=4$\_{{\ensuremath{-}}1}$$^{+2}${\texttimes}1 {}0$^{7}$M$\_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$ . We infer a very high ratio of black-hole-to-galaxy mass of at least 3\%, an order of magnitude more than that seen in local galaxies$^{5}$ and possibly as high as 100\%. The lack of strong metal lines in the spectrum together with the high bolometric luminosity (L$\_{bol}$ = (1.1 {\ensuremath{\pm}} 0.3) {\texttimes} {}10$^{45}$ erg s$^{{\ensuremath{-}}1}$) indicate that we are seeing the black hole in a phase of rapid growth, accreting at 30\% of the Eddington limit. The rapid growth and high black-hole-to-galaxy mass ratio of Abell2744-QSO1 suggest that it may represent the missing link between black hole seeds$^{6}$ and one of the first luminous quasars$^{7}$.}},

    abstract = {{JWST has detected many overmassive galactic systems at z > 4, where the mass of the black hole, M $\_{{\textbullet}}$, is 10{\textendash}100 times larger than expected from local relations, given the host's stellar mass, M $\_{{\ensuremath{\star}}}$. This paper presents a model to describe these overmassive systems in the high-z Universe. We suggest that the black hole mass is the main driver of high-z star formation quenching. Supermassive black holes globally impact their high-z galaxies because their hosts are physically small, and the black holes have duty cycles close to unity at z > 4. In this regime, we assume that black hole mass growth is regulated by the quasar's output, while stellar mass growth is quenched by it and uncorrelated to the global properties of the host halo. We find that the ratio M $\_{{\textbullet}}$/M $\_{{\ensuremath{\star}}}$ controls the average star formation efficiency: if M $\_{{\textbullet}}$/M $\_{{\ensuremath{\star}}}$ > 8 {\texttimes} {}10$^{18}$(n{\ensuremath{\Lambda}}/ f $\_{Edd}$)[({\ensuremath{\Omega}}$\_{ b }$ M $\_{ h }$)/({\ensuremath{\Omega}}$\_{ m }$ M $\_{{\ensuremath{\star}}}$) ‑ 1], then the galaxy is unable to form stars efficiently. Once this ratio exceeds the threshold, a runaway process brings the originally overmassive system toward the local M $\_{{\textbullet}}${\textendash}M $\_{{\ensuremath{\star}}}$ relation. Furthermore, the M $\_{{\textbullet}}${\textendash}M $\_{{\ensuremath{\star}}}$ relation evolves with redshift as {\ensuremath{\propto}}(1 + z)$^{5/2}$. At z {\ensuremath{\sim}} 5, we find an overmassive factor of {\ensuremath{\sim}}55, in excellent agreement with current JWST data and the high-z relation inferred from those. Extending the black hole horizon farther in redshift and lower in mass will test this model and improve our understanding of the early coevolution of black holes and galaxies.}},

We find 37 EROs in the Cosmic Evolution Early Release Science Survey (CEERS) field with F444W < 28 mag and photometric redshifts between 5 < z < 7, with median $z={6.9}\_{-1.6}^{+1.0}$ . Surprisingly, despite their red long-wavelength colors, these EROs have blue short- wavelength colors (F150W ‑ F200W {\ensuremath{\sim}} 0 mag) indicative of bimodal spectral energy distributions (SEDs) with a red, steep slope in the rest-frame optical, and a blue, flat slope in the rest-frame UV. Moreover, all these EROs are unresolved, point-like sources in all NIRCam bands. We analyze the SEDs of eight of them with MIRI and NIRSpec observations using stellar population models and active galactic nucleus (AGN) templates. We find that dusty galaxies or obscured AGNs provide similarly good SED fits but different stellar properties: massive and dusty, $\mathrm{log}{M}\_{\star }/{M}\_{\odot }$ {\ensuremath{\sim}} 10 and A $\_{ V }$ {\ensuremath{\gtrsim}} 3 mag, or low mass and obscured, $\mathrm{log}{M}\_{\star }/{M}\_{\odot }$ {\ensuremath{\sim}} 7.5 and A $\_{ V }$ {\ensuremath{\sim}} 0 mag, hosting an obscured quasi-stellar object (QSO). SED modeling does not favor either scenario, but their unresolved sizes are more suggestive of AGNs. If any EROs are confirmed to have $\mathrm{log}{M}\_{\star }/{M}\_{\odot }$ {\ensuremath{\gtrsim}} 10.5, it would increase the pre-JWST number density at z > 7 by up to a factor {\ensuremath{\sim}}60. Similarly, if they are QSOs with luminosities in the L $\_{bol}$ > 10$^{45{\textendash}46}$ erg s$^{‑1}$ range, their number would exceed that of bright blue QSOs by more than three orders of magnitude. Additional photometry at mid-infrared wavelengths will reveal the true nature of the red continuum emission in these EROs and will place this puzzling population in the right context of galaxy evolution.}},

From NIRCam photometry alone, they could have been dominated by dusty star formation or an AGN.

Remarkably, among all z $\_{phot}$ > 5 galaxies with F277W {\textendash} F444W > 1 in UNCOVER at least 33\% are AGN regardless of compactness, climbing to at least 80\% AGN for sources with F277W {\textendash} F444W > 1.6.

Models consider different seeding and accretion scenarios$^{4-7}$, which require the detection and characterization of black holes in the first few hundred million years after the Big Bang to be validated. Here we present an extensive analysis of the JWST-NIRSpec spectrum of GN-z11, an exceptionally luminous galaxy at z = 10.6, revealing the detection of the [NeIV]{\ensuremath{\lambda}}2423 and CII*{\ensuremath{\lambda}}1335 transitions (typical of active galactic nuclei), as well as semi-forbidden nebular lines tracing gas densities higher than {}10$^{9}$ cm$^{{\ensuremath{-}}3}$, typical of the broad line region of active galactic nuclei. These spectral features indicate that GN-z11 hosts an accreting black hole. The spectrum also reveals a deep and blueshifted CIV{\ensuremath{\lambda}}1549 absorption trough, tracing an outflow with velocity 800{\ensuremath{-}}1,000 km s$^{{\ensuremath{-}}1}$, probably driven by the active galactic nucleus. Assuming local virial relations, we derive a black hole mass of log (M$\_{BH}$/M$\_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$ ) =6.2 {\ensuremath{\pm}}0.3 , accreting at about five times the Eddington rate. These properties are consistent with both heavy seeds scenarios and scenarios considering intermediate and light seeds experiencing episodic super-Eddington phases. Our finding explains the high luminosity of GN-z11 and can also provide an explanation for its exceptionally high nitrogen abundance.}},

The coldest source, UNCOVER-BD-3, is near the T/Y dwarf boundary with T $\_{eff}$ = 550 K, and our analysis indicates the presence of PH$\_{3}$ in the 3{\textendash}5 {\ensuremath{\mu}}m region, favored over CO$\_{2}$ and a possible indicator of subsolar metallicity. We estimate distances of 0.9{\textendash}4.5 kpc from the Galactic midplane, making these the most distant brown dwarfs with spectroscopic confirmation. Population simulations indicate high probabilities of membership in the Galactic thick disk for two of these brown dwarfs, and potential halo membership for UNCOVER-BD-1. Our simulations indicate that there are approximately 5 T dwarfs and 1{\textendash}2 L dwarfs in the Abell 2744 field down to F444W = 30 AB mag, roughly one-third of which are thick disk members. These results highlight the utility of deep JWST/NIRSpec spectroscopy for identifying and characterizing the oldest metal-poor brown dwarfs in the Milky Way.}},

Together with existing Hubble Space Telescope (HST) imaging, this publicly available data set opens a fundamentally new discovery space to understand the remaining mysteries of the formation and evolution of galaxies across cosmic time. In this work, we detect and measure some 60,000 objects across the 49 arcmin$^{2}$ JWST footprint down to a 5{\ensuremath{\sigma}} limiting magnitude of \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde30 mag in 0.″32 apertures. Photometry is performed using circular apertures on images matched to the point-spread function (PSF) of the reddest NIRCam broad band, F444W, and cleaned of bright cluster galaxies and the related intracluster light. To give an impression of the photometric performance, we measure photometric redshifts and achieve a {\ensuremath{\sigma}} $\_{NMAD}$ {\ensuremath{\approx}} 0.03 based on known, but relatively small, spectroscopic samples. With this paper, we publicly release our HST and JWST PSF-matched photometric catalog with optimally assigned aperture sizes for easy use, along with single aperture catalogs, photometric redshifts, rest-frame colors, and individual magnification estimates. These catalogs will set the stage for efficient and deep spectroscopic follow up of some of the first JWST-selected samples in summer of 2023.}},

JWST and Hubble Space Telescope high- resolution images reveal that the majority of them show extended morphologies indicating significant contribution to the total lights from their host galaxies, except for three compact objects two of which show red spectral energy distributions, probably in a transition phase from faint AGNs to low luminosity quasars. Careful AGN-host decomposition analyses show that their host's stellar masses are systematically lower than the local relation between the black hole mass and the stellar mass, implying a fast black hole growth consistent with predictions from theoretical simulations. A high fraction of the broad-line AGNs (\raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde5\%), higher than z \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde 0, indicates that the number density of such faint AGNs is higher than an extrapolation of the quasar luminosity function, implying a large population of AGNs in the early universe.

By examining JWST galaxies at z = 4-7 that host H{\ensuremath{\alpha}}-detected black holes, we investigate (i) the high-z M $\_{{\textbullet}}$-M $\_{{\ensuremath{\star}}}$ relation and (ii) the black hole mass distribution, especially in its low-mass range (M $\_{{\textbullet}}$ {\ensuremath{\lesssim}} 10$^{6.5}$ M $\_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$). With a detailed statistical analysis, our findings conclusively reveal a high-z M $\_{{\textbullet}}$-M $\_{{\ensuremath{\star}}}$ relation that deviates at >3{\ensuremath{\sigma}} confidence level from the local relation. The high-z relation is $\mathrm{log}({M}\_{\bullet }/\,{M}\_{\odot })=-{2.43}\_{-0.83}^{+0 .83}+{1.06}\_{-0.09}^{+0.09}\mathrm{log}({M}\_{\star }/\,{M}\_{\odot })$ . Black holes are overmassive by \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde10-100{\texttimes} compared to their low-z counterparts in galactic hosts of the same stellar mass. This fact is not due to a selection effect in surveys. Moreover, our analysis predicts the possibility of detecting in high-z JWST surveys 5-15{\texttimes} more black holes with M $\_{{\textbullet}}$ {\ensuremath{\lesssim}} 10$^{6.5}$ M $\_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$, and 10-30{\texttimes} more with M $\_{{\textbullet}}$ {\ensuremath{\lesssim}} 10$^{8.5}$ M $\_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$, compared to local relation's predictions. The lighter black holes preferentially occupy galaxies with a stellar mass of \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde10$^{7.5}$-{}10$^{8}$ M $\_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$. We have yet to detect these sources because (i) they may be inactive (duty cycles 1\%-10\%), (ii) the host overshines the active galactic nucleus (AGN), or (iii) the AGN is obscured and not immediately recognizable by line diagnostics. A search of low-mass black holes in existing JWST surveys will further test the M $\_{{\textbullet}}$-M $\_{{\ensuremath{\star}}}$ relation. Current JWST fields represent a treasure trove of black hole systems at z = 4-7; their detection will provide crucial insights into their early evolution and coevolution with their galactic hosts.}},

    abstract = {{Deep observations with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) have revealed an emerging population of red pointlike sources that could provide a link between the postulated supermassive black hole seeds and observed quasars. In this work, we present a JWST/NIRSpec spectrum from the JWST Cycle 1 UNCOVER Treasury survey of a massive accreting black hole at z = 8.50 displaying a clear broad-line component as inferred from the H{\ensuremath{\beta}} line with FWHM = 3439 {\ensuremath{\pm}} 413 km s$^{-1}$, typical of the broad-line region of an active galactic nucleus (AGN). The AGN nature of this object is further supported by high ionization, as inferred from emission lines, and a point-source morphology. We compute a black hole mass of ${\mathrm{log}}\_{10}({M}\_{\mathrm{BH}}/{M}\_{\odot })=8.17\pm 0.42$ and a bolometric luminosity of L $\_{bol}$ \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde 6.6 {\texttimes} {}10$^{45}$ erg s$^{-1}$. These values imply that our object is accreting at \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde40\% of the Eddington limit. Detailed modeling of the spectral energy distribution in the optical and near-infrared, together with constraints from ALMA, indicate an upper limit on the stellar mass of ${\mathrm{log}}\_{10}({M}\_{* }/{M}\_{\odot }) 8.7$ , which would lead to an unprecedented ratio of black hole to host mass of at least \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde30\%. This is orders of magnitude higher compared to the local QSOs but consistent with recent AGN studies at high redshift with JWST. This finding suggests that a nonnegligible fraction of supermassive black holes either started out from massive seeds and/or grew at a super-Eddington rate at high redshift. Given the predicted number densities of high-z faint AGN, future NIRSpec observations of larger samples will allow us to further investigate galaxy-black hole coevolution in the early Universe.}},

    abstract = {{We present the JWST cycle 1 53.8 h medium program FRESCO, short for 'First Reionization Epoch Spectroscopically Complete Observations'. FRESCO covers 62 arcmin$^{2}$ in each of the two GOODS/CANDELS fields for a total area of 124 arcmin$^{2}$ exploiting JWST's powerful new grism spectroscopic capabilities at near-infrared wavelengths. By obtaining \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde2 h deep NIRCam/grism observations with the F444W filter, FRESCO yields unprecedented spectra at R \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde 1600 covering 3.8-5.0 {\textmu}m for most galaxies in the NIRCam field of view. This setup enables emission line measurements over most of cosmic history, from strong PAH lines at z \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde 0.2-0.5, to Pa {\ensuremath{\alpha}} and Pa {\ensuremath{\beta}} at z \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde 1-3, He I and [S III] at z \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde 2.5-4.5, H {\ensuremath{\alpha}} and [N II] at z \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde 5-6.5, up to [O III] and H {\ensuremath{\beta}} for z \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde 7-9 galaxies. FRESCO's grism observations provide total line fluxes for accurately estimating galaxy stellar masses and calibrating slit-loss corrections of NIRSpec/MSA spectra in the same field. Additionally, FRESCO results in a mosaic of F182M, F210M, and F444W imaging in the same fields to a depth of \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde28.2 mag (5{\ensuremath{\sigma}} in 0${\_{.}^{\prime\prime}}$32 diameter apertures). Here, we describe the overall survey design and the key science goals that can be addressed with FRESCO. We also highlight several, early science results, including: spectroscopic redshifts of Lyman break galaxies that were identified almost 20 yr ago, the discovery of broad-line active galactic nuclei at z > 4, and resolved Pa {\ensuremath{\alpha}} maps of galaxies at z \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde 1.4.

    abstract = {{Spitzer/Infrared Array Camera (IRAC) imaging has revealed that the brightest z \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde 7-8 galaxies often exhibit young ages and strong nebular line emission, hinting at high ionizing efficiency among early galaxies. However, IRAC's limited sensitivity has long hindered efforts to study the fainter, more numerous population often thought largely responsible for reionization. Here, we use Cosmic Evolution Early Release Science (CEERS) JWST/NIRCam data to characterize 116 ultraviolet (UV)-faint (median M$\_{UV}$ = -19.5) z \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde 6.5-8 galaxies. The spectral energy distributions are typically dominated by young (\raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde10-50 Myr), low-mass (M$\_{*}$ \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde {}10$^{8}$ M$\_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$) stellar populations, and we find no need for extremely high stellar masses (\raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde{}10$^{11}$ M$\_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$). Considering previous studies of UV- bright (M$\_{UV}$ \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde -22) z \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde 7-8 galaxies, we find evidence for a strong (5-10 times) increase in specific star formation rate (sSFR) toward lower luminosities (median sSFR = 103 Gyr$^{-1}$ in CEERS). The larger sSFRs imply a more dominant contribution from OB stars in the relatively numerous UV-faint population, perhaps suggesting that these galaxies are very efficient ionizing agents (median {\ensuremath{\xi}}$\_{ion}$ = 10$^{25.7}$ erg$^{-1}$ Hz). In spite of the much larger sSFRs, we find little increase in [O III] + H {\ensuremath{\beta}} equivalent widths towards fainter M$\_{UV}$ (median {\ensuremath{\approx}}780 $\mathrm{\mathring{A}}$). If confirmed, this may indicate that a substantial fraction of our CEERS galaxies possess extremely low metallicities ({\ensuremath{\lesssim}}3 per cent Z$\_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$) where [O III] emission is suppressed. Alternatively, high ionizing photon escape fractions or bursty star formation histories can also weaken the nebular lines in a subset of our sample. While the majority of galaxies in our sample are very blue (median {\ensuremath{\beta}} = -2.0), we identify a significant tail of very dusty galaxies ({\ensuremath{\beta}} \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde -1) at {\ensuremath{\approx}}0.5$L\_\mathrm{UV}^\ast$ which may contribute significantly to the z \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde 7-8 star formation rate density.}},

Here we fit S{\'e}rsic profiles to the F200W NIRCam images of the 13 massive galaxy candidates of Labb{\'e} et al., to determine their structural parameters. Satisfactory fits were obtained for nine galaxies. We find that their effective radii are extremely small, ranging from r $\_{e}$ \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde 80 pc to r $\_{e}$ \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde 300 pc, with a mean of <r $\_{e}$> {\ensuremath{\approx}} 150 pc. For their apparent stellar masses, the galaxies are smaller than any other galaxy population that has been observed at any other redshift. We use the fits to derive circularized three-dimensional stellar mass profiles of the galaxies, and compare these to the mass profiles of massive quiescent galaxies at z \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde 2.3 and nearby elliptical galaxies. Despite the fact that the high-redshift galaxies have 10-20 times smaller half-light radii than their putative descendants, the central stellar densities are very similar. The most straightforward interpretation is that the dense compact inner regions of the most massive ellipticals today were already in place \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde600 Myr after the Big Bang. We caution that the redshifts and masses of the galaxies remain to be confirmed, and that the complex NIRCam point-spread function is not yet fully characterized.}},

    abstract = {{The James Webb Space Telescope is now detecting early black holes (BHs) as they transition from ``seeds'' to supermassive BHs. Recently, Bogdan et al. reported the detection of an X-ray luminous supermassive BH, UHZ-1, with a photometric redshift at z > 10. Such an extreme source at this very high redshift provides new insights on seeding and growth models for BHs given the short time available for formation and growth. Harnessing the exquisite sensitivity of JWST/NIRSpec, here we report the spectroscopic confirmation of UHZ-1 at z = 10.073 {\ensuremath{\pm}} 0.002. We find that the NIRSpec/Prism spectrum is typical of recently discovered z {\ensuremath{\approx}} 10 galaxies, characterized primarily by star formation features. We see no clear evidence of the powerful X-ray source in the rest-frame UV/optical spectrum, which may suggest heavy obscuration of the central BH, in line with the Compton-thick column density measured in the X-rays. We perform a stellar population fit simultaneously to the new NIRSpec spectroscopy and previously available photometry. The fit yields a stellar-mass estimate for the host galaxy that is significantly better constrained than prior photometric estimates ( ${M}\_{\star }\sim {1.4}\_{-0.4}^{+0.3}\times {10}^{8}$ M $\_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$). Given the predicted BH mass (M $\_{BH}$ \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde {}10$^{7}$-{}10$^{8}$ M $\_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$), the resulting ratio of M $\_{BH}$/M $\_{{\ensuremath{\star}}}$ remains 2 to 3 orders of magnitude higher than local values, thus lending support to the heavy seeding channel for the formation of supermassive BHs within the first billion years of cosmic evolution.}},

    abstract = {{We report on the discovery of two low-luminosity, broad-line active galactic nuclei (AGNs) at z > 5 identified using JWST NIRSpec spectroscopy from the Cosmic Evolution Early Release Science (CEERS) survey. We detect broad H{\ensuremath{\alpha}} emission in the spectra of both sources, with FWHM of 2060 {\ensuremath{\pm}} 290 km s$^{‑1}$ and 1800 {\ensuremath{\pm}} 200 km s$^{‑1}$, resulting in virial black hole (BH) masses that are 1{\textendash}2 dex below those of existing samples of luminous quasars at z > 5. The first source, CEERS 2782 at z = 5.242, is 2{\textendash}3 dex fainter than known quasars at similar redshifts and was previously identified as a candidate low-luminosity AGN based on its morphology and rest-frame optical spectral energy distribution (SED). We measure a BH mass of M $\_{BH}$ = (1.3 {\ensuremath{\pm}} 0.4) {\texttimes} {}10$^{7}$ M $\_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$, confirming that this AGN is powered by the least massive BH known in the Universe at the end of cosmic reionization. The second source, CEERS 746 at z = 5.624, is inferred to be a heavily obscured, broad-line AGN caught in a transition phase between a dust-obscured starburst and an unobscured quasar. We estimate its BH mass to be in the range of M $\_{BH}$ ≃ (0.9{\textendash}4.7) {\texttimes} {}10$^{7}$ M $\_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$, depending on the level of dust obscuration assumed. We perform SED fitting to derive host stellar masses, M $\_{{\ensuremath{\star}}}$, allowing us to place constraints on the BH{\textendash}galaxy mass relationship in the lowest mass range yet probed in the early Universe. The M $\_{BH}$/M $\_{{\ensuremath{\star}}}$ ratio for CEERS 2782, in particular, is consistent with or higher than the empirical relationship seen in massive galaxies at z = 0. We examine the narrow emission line ratios of both sources and find that their location on the BPT and OHNO diagrams is consistent with model predictions for moderately low metallicity AGNs with Z/Z $\_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$ ≃ 0.2{\textendash}0.4. The spectroscopic identification of low-luminosity, broad-line AGNs at z > 5 with M $\_{BH}$ ≃ {}10$^{7}$ M $\_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$ demonstrates the capability of JWST to push BH masses closer to the range predicted for the BH seed population and provides a unique opportunity to study the early stages of BH{\textendash}galaxy assembly.}},

We derive a redshift of z = 10.603 (lower than previous determinations) based on multiple emission lines in our low and medium resolution spectra over 0.7 {\ensuremath{-}} 5.3 {\ensuremath{\mu}}m. We significantly detect the continuum and measure a blue rest-UV spectral slope of {\ensuremath{\beta}} = {\ensuremath{-}}2.4. Remarkably, we see spatially extended Lyman-{\ensuremath{\alpha}} in emission (despite the highly neutral intergalactic medium expected at this early epoch), offset 555 km s$^{{\ensuremath{-}}1}$ redwards of the systemic redshift. From our measurements of collisionally excited lines of both low and high ionisation (including [O II] {\ensuremath{\lambda}}3727, [Ne III] {\ensuremath{\lambda}}3869, and C III] {\ensuremath{\lambda}}1909), we infer a high ionisation parameter (log U {\ensuremath{\sim}} {\ensuremath{-}}2). We detect the rarely seen N IV] {\ensuremath{\lambda}}1486 and N III] {\ensuremath{\lambda}}1748 lines in both our low and medium resolution spectra, with other high ionisation lines seen in the low resolution spectrum, such as He II (blended with O III]) and C IV (with a possible P-Cygni profile). Based on the observed rest-UV line ratios, we cannot conclusively rule out photoionisation from an active galactic nucleus (AGN), although the high C III]/He II and N III]/He II ratios are compatible with a star formation explanation. If the observed emission lines are powered by star formation, then the strong N III] {\ensuremath{\lambda}}1748 observed may imply an unusually high N/O abundance. Balmer emission lines (H{\ensuremath{\gamma}}, H{\ensuremath{\delta}}) are also detected, and if powered by star formation rather than an AGN, we infer a star formation rate of {\ensuremath{\sim}}20 {\ensuremath{-}} 30 M$\_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$ yr$^{{\ensuremath{-}}1}$ (depending on the initial mass function) and low dust attenuation. Our NIRSpec spectroscopy confirms that GN-z11 is a remarkable galaxy with extreme properties seen 430 Myr after the Big Bang.}},

The design of COSMOS-Web is motivated by three primary science goals: (1) to discover thousands of galaxies in the Epoch of Reionization (6 {\ensuremath{\lesssim}} z {\ensuremath{\lesssim}} 11) and map reionization's spatial distribution, environments, and drivers on scales sufficiently large to mitigate cosmic variance, (2) to identify hundreds of rare quiescent galaxies at z > 4 and place constraints on the formation of the universe's most-massive galaxies (M $\_{{\ensuremath{\star}}}$ > {}10$^{10}$ M $\_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$), and (3) directly measure the evolution of the stellar-mass-to-halo-mass relation using weak gravitational lensing out to z \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde 2.5 and measure its variance with galaxies' star formation histories and morphologies. In addition, we anticipate COSMOS- Web's legacy value to reach far beyond these scientific goals, touching many other areas of astrophysics, such as the identification of the first direct collapse black hole candidates, ultracool subdwarf stars in the Galactic halo, and possibly the identification of z > 10 pair-instability supernovae. In this paper we provide an overview of the survey's key measurements, specifications, goals, and prospects for new discovery.}},

    abstract = {{We present rest-frame optical data of the compact z = 5.55 galaxy GS\_3073 obtained using the integral field spectroscopy mode of the Near-InfraRed Spectrograph on board the James Webb Space Telescope. The galaxy's prominent broad components in several hydrogen and helium lines (though absent in the forbidden lines) and v detection of a large equivalent width of He II{\ensuremath{\lambda}}4686, EW(He II) {\ensuremath{\sim}}20 {\r{A}}, unambiguously identify it as an active galactic nucleus (AGN). We measured a gas phase metallicity of Z$\_{gas}$/Z$\_{{\en suremath{\odot}}}${\ensuremath{\sim}}0.21$\_{{\ensuremath{-}}0.04 }$$^{+0.08}$ , which is lower than what has been inferred for both more luminous AGN at a similar redshift and lower redshift AGN. We empirically show that classical emission line ratio diagnostic diagrams cannot be used to distinguish between the primary ionisation source (AGN or star formation) for systems with such low metallicity, though different diagnostic diagrams involving He II{\ensuremath{\lambda}}4686 prove very useful, independent of metallicity. We measured the central black hole mass to be log(M$\_{BH}$/M$\_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$){\ensuremath{\sim}}8.2 {\ensuremath{\pm}} 0.4 based on the luminosity and width of the broad line region of the H{\ensuremath{\alpha}} emission. While this places GS\_3073 at the lower end of known high-redshift black hole masses, it still appears to be overly massive when compared to its host galaxy's mass properties. We detected an outflow with a projected velocity {\ensuremath{\gtrsim}}700 km s$^{{\ensuremath{-}}1}$ and inferred an ionised gas mass outflow rate of about 100 M$\_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$ yr$^{{\ensuremath{-}}1}$, suggesting that one billion years after the Big Bang, GS\_3073 is able to enrich the intergalactic medium with metals.}},

All three images are very compact, i.e., unresolved, with a delensed size upper limit of r $\_{ e }$ {\ensuremath{\lesssim}} 35 pc. The images have apparent magnitudes of m $\_{F444W}$ \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde 25-26 AB, and the magnification-corrected absolute UV magnitude of the source is M $\_{UV,1450}$ = -16.81 {\ensuremath{\pm}} 0.09. From the sum of observed fluxes and from a spectral energy distribution (SED) analysis, we obtain estimates of the bolometric luminosities of the source of L $\_{bol}$ {\ensuremath{\gtrsim}} {}10$^{43}$ erg s$^{-1}$ and L $\_{bol}$ \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde {}10$^{44}$-{}10$^{46}$ erg s$^{-1}$, respectively. Based on its compact, point-like appearance, its position in color-color space, and the SED analysis, we tentatively conclude that this object is a UV-faint dust-obscured quasar-like object, i.e., an active galactic nucleus at high redshift. We also discuss other alternative origins for the object's emission features, including a massive star cluster, Population III, supermassive, or dark stars, or a direct-collapse black hole. Although populations of red galaxies at similar photometric redshifts have been detected with JWST, this object is unique in that its high-redshift nature is corroborated geometrically by lensing, that it is unresolved despite being magnified-and thus intrinsically even more compact-and that it occupies notably distinct regions in both size-luminosity and color-color space. Planned UNCOVER JWST/NIRSpec observations, scheduled in Cycle 1, will enable a more detailed analysis of this object.}},

This galaxy, denoted here as CEERS\_1019, was previously discovered as a Ly{\ensuremath{\alpha}}-break galaxy by Hubble with a Ly{\ensuremath{\alpha}} redshift from Keck. As part of the Cosmic Evolution Early Release Science (CEERS) survey, we have observed this source with JWST/NIRSpec, MIRI, NIRCam, and NIRCam/WFSS and uncovered a plethora of emission lines. The H{\ensuremath{\beta}} line is best fit by a narrow plus a broad component, where the latter is measured at 2.5{\ensuremath{\sigma}} with an FWHM \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde1200 km s$^{-1}$. We conclude this originates in the broadline region of an active galactic nucleus (AGN). This is supported by the presence of weak high- ionization lines (N V, N IV], and C III]), as well as a spatial point-source component. The implied mass of the black hole (BH) is log (M $\_{BH}$/M $\_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$) = 6.95 {\ensuremath{\pm}} 0.37, and we estimate that it is accreting at 1.2 {\ensuremath{\pm}} 0.5 times the Eddington limit. The 1-8 {\ensuremath{\mu}}m photometric spectral energy distribution shows a continuum dominated by starlight and constrains the host galaxy to be massive (log M/M$\_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$ \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde9.5) and highly star-forming (star formation rate, or SFR \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde 30 M$\_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$ yr$^{-1}$; log sSFR \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde - 7.9 yr$^{-1}$). The line ratios show that the gas is metal-poor (Z/Z $\_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$ \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde 0.1), dense (n $\_{ e }$ \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde {}10$^{3}$ cm$^{-3}$), and highly ionized (log U \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde - 2.1). We use this present highest-redshift AGN discovery to place constraints on BH seeding models and find that a combination of either super- Eddington accretion from stellar seeds or Eddington accretion from very massive BH seeds is required to form this object.}},

    abstract = {{The extremely rapid assembly of the earliest galaxies during the first billion years of cosmic history is a major challenge for our understanding of galaxy formation physics$^{1-5}$. The advent of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has exacerbated this issue by confirming the existence of galaxies in substantial numbers as early as the first few hundred million years$^{6-8}$. Perhaps even more surprisingly, in some galaxies, this initial highly efficient star formation rapidly shuts down, or quenches, giving rise to massive quiescent galaxies as little as 1.5 billion years after the Big Bang$^{9,10}$. However, due to their faintness and red colour, it has proven extremely challenging to learn about these extreme quiescent galaxies, or to confirm whether any existed at earlier times. Here we report the spectroscopic confirmation of a massive quiescent galaxy, GS-9209, at redshift, z = 4.658, just 1.25 billion years after the Big Bang, using the JWST Near-Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSpec). From these data we infer a stellar mass of M$\_{*}$ = 3.8 {\ensuremath{\pm}} 0.2 {\texttimes} {}10$^{10}$ M$\_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$, which formed over a roughly 200 Myr period before this galaxy quenched its star-formation activity at z =6.5$\_{-0.5}$$^{+0.2}$ , when the Universe was approximately 800 Myr old. This galaxy is both a likely descendent of the highest-redshift submillimetre galaxies and quasars, and a likely progenitor for the dense, ancient cores of the most massive local galaxies.}},

An immediate concern is the consistency of these candidates with galaxy formation in the standard {\ensuremath{\Lambda}}CDM cosmological model, wherein the stellar mass (M$\_{{\ensuremath{\star}}}$) of a galaxy is limited by the available baryonic reservoir of its host dark matter halo. The mass function of dark matter haloes therefore imposes an absolute upper limit on the number density n (>M$\_{{\ensuremath{\star}}}$, z) and stellar mass density {\ensuremath{\rho}}$\_{{\ensuremath{\star}}}$ (>M$\_{{\ensuremath{\star}}}$, z) of galaxies more massive than M$\_{{\ensuremath{\star}}}$ at any epoch z.

CEERS, one of 13 JWST ERS programs, targets galaxy formation from z \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde 0.5 to >10 using several imaging and spectroscopic modes. We make use of the first epoch of CEERS NIRCam imaging, spanning 35.5 arcmin$^{2}$, to search for candidate galaxies at z > 9. Following a detailed data reduction process implementing several custom steps to produce high-quality reduced images, we perform multiband photometry across seven NIRCam broad- and medium-band (and six Hubble broadband) filters focusing on robust colors and accurate total fluxes. We measure photometric redshifts and devise a robust set of selection criteria to identify a sample of 26 galaxy candidates at z \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde 9-16. These objects are compact with a median half-light radius of \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde0.5 kpc. We present an early estimate of the z \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde 11 rest-frame ultraviolet (UV) luminosity function, finding that the number density of galaxies at M $\_{UV}$ \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde -20 appears to evolve very little from z \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde 9 to 11. We also find that the abundance (surface density [arcmin$^{-2}$]) of our candidates exceeds nearly all theoretical predictions. We explore potential implications, including that at z > 10, star formation may be dominated by top-heavy initial mass functions, which would result in an increased ratio of UV light per unit halo mass, though a complete lack of dust attenuation and/or changing star formation physics may also play a role. While spectroscopic confirmation of these sources is urgently required, our results suggest that the deeper views to come with JWST should yield prolific samples of ultrahigh-redshift galaxies with which to further explore these conclusions.}},

    abstract = {{We report a candidate of a low-luminosity active galactic nucleus (AGN) at z = 5 that was selected from the first near-infrared images of the JWST CEERS project. This source, named CEERS-AGN-z5-1 at absolute 1450 {\r{A}} magnitude M $\_{1450}$ = -19.5 {\ensuremath{\pm}} 0.3, was found via a visual selection of compact sources from a catalog of Lyman break galaxies at z > 4, taking advantage of the superb spatial resolution of the JWST/NIRCam images. The 20 photometric data available from CFHT, Hubble Space Telescope, Spitzer, and JWST suggest that the continuum shape of this source is reminiscent of that for an unobscured AGN, and there is a clear color excess in the filters where the redshifted H{\ensuremath{\beta}}+[O III] and H{\ensuremath{\alpha}} are covered. The estimated line luminosity is L $\_{H{\ensuremath{\beta}}+[O III]}$ = 10$^{43.0}$ erg s$^{-1}$ and L $\_{H{\ensuremath{\alpha}} }$ = 10$^{42.9}$ erg s$^{-1}$ with the corresponding rest-frame equivalent width EW$\_{H{\ensuremath{\beta}}+[O III]}$ = 1100 {\r{A}} and EW$\_{H{\ensuremath{\alpha}} }$ = 1600 {\r{A}}, respectively. Our spectral energy distribution fitting analysis favors the scenario that this object is either a strong broad-line emitter or even a super-Eddington accreting black hole (BH), although a possibility of an extremely young galaxy with moderate dust attenuation is not completely ruled out. The bolometric luminosity, L $\_{bol}$ = 2.5 {\ensuremath{\pm}} 0.3 {\texttimes} {}10$^{44}$ erg s$^{-1}$, is consistent with those of z < 0.35 broad-line AGNs with M $\_{BH}$ \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde {}10$^{6}$ M $\_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$ accreting at the Eddington limit. This new AGN population in the first 1.1 billion years of the universe may close the gap between the observed BH mass range at high redshift and that of BH seeds. Spectroscopic confirmation is awaited to secure the redshift and its AGN nature.}},

    abstract = {{Understanding how super-massive black holes form and grow in the early Universe has become a major challenge$^{1,2}$ since it was discovered that luminous quasars existed only 700 million years after the Big Bang$^{3,4}$. Simulations indicate an evolutionary sequence of dust-reddened quasars emerging from heavily dust- obscured starbursts that then transition to unobscured luminous quasars by expelling gas and dust$^{5}$. Although the last phase has been identified out to a redshift of 7.6 (ref. $^{6}$), a transitioning quasar has not been found at similar redshifts owing to their faintness at optical and near-infrared wavelengths. Here we report observations of an ultraviolet compact object, GNz7q, associated with a dust-enshrouded starburst at a redshift of 7.1899 {\ensuremath{\pm}} 0.0005. The host galaxy is more luminous in dust emission than any other known object at this epoch, forming 1,600 solar masses of stars per year within a central radius of 480 parsec. A red point source in the far-ultraviolet is identified in deep, high- resolution imaging and slitless spectroscopy. GNz7q is extremely faint in X-rays, which indicates the emergence of a uniquely ultraviolet compact star-forming region or a Compton-thick super-Eddington black-hole accretion disk at the dusty starburst core. In the latter case, the observed properties are consistent with predictions from cosmological simulations$^{7}$ and suggest that GNz7q is an antecedent to unobscured luminous quasars at later epochs.}},
